      <title>Angels as Agents of Transfer between Hebrew Origins, Byzantium, and Western Europe. Marienberg in South Tyrol as a Case Study</title>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Angels are major spirits in Byzantine and western Christian rites. Their sources are rooted in the Hebrew traditions of the Old Testament, which were adapted and enlarged in the New Testament both in Byzantium and Western Europe. This paper investigates the transcultural potential of angels by focusing on their relation to liturgical practices of Byzantine origin and their application in western rites. The text examines their angelic function and the application of angelic figures in a sacral space by choosing the example of the crypt of Marienberg, in South Tyrol, with its unique medieval murals, where angels play a key role in the outer and inner space of the ensemble. As shown, iconographical models of Byzantine origin were first adapted and then transformed in Marienberg, where angels serve as guardians and &#8220;fixed points&#8221; in spaces of threshold which relate them to spaces of Hebrew origin.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In the middle ages, Byzantine art traveled through South Tyrol on its way from Sicily to Salzburg, via Venice. Because it came through South Tyrol and presumably was seen by local artists, elements of Byzantine art were adapted in local artistic expressions. Trade and pilgrim routes that were suitable for transcultural exchanges crossed the area (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID04102b01-a671-4b36-b042-672d0b337de8">Stampfer and Steppan 2008, 30&#8211;31 and 34&#8211;35</xref>). The Benedictine monastery of Marienberg&#8212;which was still active in the Middle Ages&#8212;was situated next to the village of Burgeis, on the important Via Claudia Augusta, an ancient pass established in Roman times to link northern Italy with what is now southern Germany across the Alps. Local murals of the Romanesque period (<xref rid="ID7f2c9859-84b6-4a0f-ab1f-7680c5d60b4d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4b6e3ed6-b69b-4247-b211-66b8c19d3a8d">1000&#8211;1250</xref>), in particular, testify to the adoption of certain cross-cultural artistic elements in Marienberg. Angels populate the pictorial program of the crypt (<xref rid="IDba21128c-c664-44b6-9d5b-17aff0cabbb8" ref-type="bibr" id="ID145091b4-0c8a-4366-b81c-aba9aa4cab88">Steppan 2007, 679</xref>).</p>
      <p>The crypt of the church belonging to the Benedictine monastery of Marienberg is a narrow, rectangular space, with three apses in the east that are not visible from the outside. Between the main apse and the much smaller northern and southern apses are two doors that allow entrance to the crypt from the outside. On the western side of the room, steps lead to the aisles of the upper church. The crypt is lit by small oculi in the apses, which allow daylight to enter. The groin vault is divided into five bays (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb605a2c0-c217-4a35-97a2-18e606dcbc8a">Fig. 1</xref>). The baroque tombs of the prelates that covered large parts of the west, north, and south walls were removed at the beginning of the 1980s, revealing the murals behind them (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb883e5e3-bc22-4223-b211-c7bb9c58573d">Stampfer and Walder 2002, 11&#8211;12</xref>). For the surviving crypt paintings, dating varies between the consecration of the crypt in 1160 and 1185 (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDade28c75-fb63-4935-9eda-fe1c86ef9bb8">Fig. 2</xref>) and, for the outer-space murals, between 1163 and the first decade of the thirteenth century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e58"/>

      <p>The most important source for the history of the monastery of Marienberg is the so-called <italic>Registrum Goswini</italic>, written by the monk Goswin in the fourteenth century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e75"/> Goswin writes that the patron of the monastery, Ulrich III of Tarasp (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID433c914f-5f64-4390-8c7f-e5b2e2d6398e">d. 1177</xref>), a local nobleman, ordered the building of the monastery near the village of Burgeis, in the Vinschgau area (<xref rid="ID98029296-cb25-4261-aace-24b5a4c7f9ed" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf0757cb5-1ecd-4db3-856a-6edd0f37cdd4">Goswin 1996, 64</xref>). The chronicler further informs the reader that the crypt was the first sacral room to be built and that it was consecrated in 1160 by bishop Adelgott of Chur. The <italic>Registrum</italic> mentioned the function of the crypt clearly: firstly, it served the monastery community for the celebration of the mass. Secondly, it was where the Liturgy of the Hours was held during the period of time when the other buildings were not yet finished (<xref rid="ID98029296-cb25-4261-aace-24b5a4c7f9ed" ref-type="bibr" id="ID76d257c7-9a76-465f-b219-11bca0090499">Goswin 1996, 108</xref>). For about forty years, the community held the Hours inside the crypt until, as Goswin describes later, the church of the monastery was consecrated around 1201 (<xref rid="ID98029296-cb25-4261-aace-24b5a4c7f9ed" ref-type="bibr" id="ID009f1013-b39a-46ea-96cc-5ddd42c865cb">Goswin 1996, 158</xref>).</p>
      <p>Goswin mentions the patrons of Marienberg, Ulrich and his wife Uta, several times to express his gratitude for their rich donations and to ensure their memory. As part of this patronage, Ulrich III of Tarasp ordered relics from Western Europe and the Holy Land and donated them for the altars of the crypt and the upper church (<xref rid="ID98029296-cb25-4261-aace-24b5a4c7f9ed" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa352b517-57ac-4d0f-8d1d-cecdeddfb77b">Goswin 1996, 160</xref>). While he and his son became lay brothers of the monastery, his wife Uta became a nun. She died during a journey to the Holy Land in 1163, where she hoped to visit the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. Ulrich himself went on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and brought his wife&#8217;s remains back to Marienberg, where he died in 1177.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e99"/> Both patrons were pictured in the crypt, but only some fragments of Uta&#8217;s portrait as a nun, to the south of the main apse, and some words mentioned in full length in the <italic>Registrum</italic>, have survived. The picture of Ulrich in pilgrim clothes that Goswin describes is no longer visible, but was surely the counterpart of Uta&#8217;s representation and reminded the reader of the donations made by the patrons and their future reward in heaven (<xref rid="ID98029296-cb25-4261-aace-24b5a4c7f9ed" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfa767fe4-5595-4220-9816-b4a310aa57a2">Goswin 1996, 108</xref>)<italic>.</italic> 
         </p>
      <p>This essay argues that the outer space, which connects with the crypt through two doors, was an atrium and served as a burial place for these patrons, the so-called <italic>non valde mali &#8220;not very bad ones&#8221;</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e120"/> I investigate the involvement of angels who play an important role in the pictorial program of the crypt and its outer space.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e126"/> Placing them in the framework of an investigation of cross-cultural entanglement, they are described and their iconographical Byzantine elements are examined, as is their comparison with the analysis of the topic of the Christ in Majesty (Lat. <italic>Majestas Domini</italic>), which, in turn, is closely connected to angels. The essay surveys the Marienberg angels and their iconography and addresses their relation to textual sources such as the Book of Revelation (the final book of the New Testament, composed in the first century CE) and one Byzantine text, <italic>de caelestis hierarchia</italic> by Pseudo-Dionysius (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3c9ebc35-a533-4538-96f9-36cf07c6b40d">early sixth century</xref>), which, from the early Middle Ages, was widely distributed and appreciated in Western Christianity and included in the liturgy. Last but not least, the angels are contextualized in their relation to the (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc165c269-8522-4b1e-bee7-4ec39a70ac4c">cryptic</xref>) space in Marienberg, which is closely connected to liminal states, as this space enforces another aspect of cultural translation:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e141"/> the spatial position of the Tabernacle of the Israelites which becomes a Christian temple in the murals of Marienberg. The term &#8220;translation&#8221; is appropriate to outline the situation in Marienberg as the original model was not copied, but &#8220;translated&#8221; into a new cultural context.</p>

      <title>Iconographical translations: Byzantine models for Christ in Majesty and angels</title>
      <p>On the outside of the main apse, only a few fragments of paintings remain (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb20782e5-3f4d-4b5b-b650-c7ba5396ff85">Figs. 3 and 4</xref>). On the outside of the smaller northern apse, the architecture is covered with a painted multicolor curtain that is decorated at its border with precious stones (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1b2ddf69-05f6-4e75-a9fb-fcac46c8a84f">Fig. 3</xref>). Under the oculus, the curtain is decorated with ornaments that are depicted in squares but still let the painted curtain shine through. A male figure with a green coat, red trousers, a red cap, and a rod in his hand, moves towards the northern entrance of the crypt on the right side of the oculus.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 3 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 4 here]</p>
      <p>The curtain theme is not maintained on the northern outer wall of the main apse (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdff7f7ea-18db-4d53-a6d4-7d8d5877b727">Fig. 4</xref>). Instead, a two-color band encloses the scene on the upper end. Two figures with yellow and green clothes turn to the right with a gesture of prayer towards two angels that can only be identified by the preserved fragments of their two-color wings. The background of the scene is divided into two areas of color. The lower half, which extends to the neck of the figures, is red, the upper half green. On the left side of the figures are three white &#8220;drops&#8221; with green insertions. Scholars have interpreted these &#8220;drops&#8221; as lanterns or stylized trees with leaves.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e172"/>
         </p>
      <p>In contrast to the  fragmentary  paintings of the outer space, the frescoes of the crypt&#8217;s inner space are in better condition and are preserved particularly well in the main apse, the vault of the middle bay, and the western wall. In the main apse, directly positioned over the oculus, one can see Christ in Majesty being enthroned and surrounded by a halo and mandorla (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID04d5e0c2-b43a-45e1-ab81-7af4ef186a1d">Fig. 5</xref>), both of which are transcultural indicators of the divine in various religions (compare, for example, Pradel Figs. 4, 5, and 6, Kuehn Fig. 4, Gutschow Figs. 5 and 14, and Weiler Fig. 1 in this volume). Christ is clothed in red and white and holds an open book in his left hand, while his right hand is elevated in a gesture of blessing. Christ in Majesty is flanked by human figures on both sides of the composition. The background is formed by bands of different colors and thickness that are horizontally arranged and follow the elevated form of the mandorla. Two symbols of evangelists&#8212;the steer of Luke and the lion of Mark&#8212;are positioned on the lower level. The steer on the right side is holding the gospel of Luke, which is decorated with precious stones (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDacf8c3d4-ca14-4fe7-9ccd-e79623bd0754">Fig. 6</xref>). The same attribute was probably added to the lion on the left side (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8c0befd5-1bf6-4c79-be58-830e59e9cfb5">Fig. 7</xref>). Although both the steer and the lion turn away from the <italic>majestas</italic>, they glance at Christ. Further to the right on the same level there are a few preserved remains of the symbol of Matthew the angel, with the gospel in his hand (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc8664eb9-1025-4269-816d-9e2aecaedcd2">Fig. 6</xref>). The eagle of John must have been on the opposite side, though only fragments of the head and the wings remain (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID68476d35-3940-45c7-b860-aba9631b6169">Fig. 7</xref>). On the same level as the symbols are the apostles Peter on the left and Paul on the right (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID33fd180b-8e5d-4433-822e-71083bc6227f">Figs. 6 and 7</xref>). Peter is holding his attribute, the key, and Paul, the book. The apostles do not look upon Christ in Majesty, but can be understood as intercessors for the believers. Two female figures, with their palm leaf attributes, are inserted as the apostles&#8217; counterparts in the window jambs. They look up at the apostles and communicate between the inner and outer space of the crypt and the atrium. These figures have been identified as the martyrs Climaria and Panafreta, whose relics were placed in the altar (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDabac18b2-ac20-43e0-b007-3b092f1a8e6a">Stamper and Steppan 2008, 196</xref>).</p>
      <p>On the same level as the apostles, one can see a smaller monk depicted on the left side (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID95c71bf4-d7ca-4792-9ede-a6575e66c21d">Fig. 7</xref>). He is the only figure in the apse without an aureole and can be understood as a deputy of the believers, for whom the apostles intercede. The symbols of the Evangelists, the apostles, and the monk all occupy one level marked by a stripe with floral ornaments.</p>
      <p>One level above, on a white stripe, two winged angels (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb414ade3-de8b-4a7a-b07f-4adff7cb0840">Figs. 5, 6 and 7</xref>) stand on their own little platforms, next to the Christ in Majesty. One wing of each angel follows the form of the mandorla and touches it. By doing so, the angels  separate the mandorla from the heads of the apostles. The angels hold banderoles that lack any text passages, thus perhaps intending to merely communicate the character of a scroll (compare to Ebba Koch&#8217;s study of the seventeenth century Kala Burj in this volume). The faces of the winged angels, probably two cherubim, are elevated toward the Christ in Majesty. Three levels above, two seraphim (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID71af3dd4-08fa-4de3-8c88-2b4ef8204bae">Figs. 5, 6 and 7</xref>) can be identified by their six wings. The uppermost pairs of their wings follow the dome of the mandorla and the transverse arch. The seraphim, too, look toward Christ and elevate their hands in prayer. In the entire composition, only the angels are fully aware of the heavenly vision, which they protect with their wings against exterior viewing by the apostles and the monk. They even stand on a higher level and are taller than the other figures, indicating their importance and proximity to the Lord.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 5 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 6 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 7 here]</p>
      <p>Seraphim with six wings are mentioned in the Old Testament vision of Isaiah (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID81d5b7cc-8a2a-46c9-86ed-6d67b6d38832">Is 6:1-7</xref>), where they surround God&#8217;s throne (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0b4b81e4-72fa-4ac5-b0b8-778353774ef2">Geretti 2010, 11 and Madersbacher 1996, 84</xref>) and recite the Sanctus to praise God. The word &#8220;cherubim&#8221; can be found fifty-eight times in the Old Testament and once in the New Testament, in the letter to the Hebrews (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe027578f-7fca-4f9d-9c08-4b8baf2ad24e">Heb 9:5</xref>). It is striking indeed that in all text passages of the Bible that mention the cherubim, the number of wings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb2abbfb4-3de2-43c9-99f0-cff94bee6d27">two</xref>) is mentioned only twice, in the description of the wooden cherubim in the temple of Solomon (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcfa85dd1-218a-47c2-912e-4c5ee53cbca4">1 Kgs 6:27</xref>) (<xref rid="ID0e3840a3-9682-4457-963d-88c45dbeed50" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6105488a-a20b-4968-ae51-e669ad599131">Iacobini 2000, 136</xref>). In contrast, cherubim are described as having four wings in the vision of Ezekiel (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe6a1ff5a-53b8-4f43-be20-8bfa555c4261">Ez 10:21</xref>). Both traditions can be traced in iconography, although the depiction with two wings was rare.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e229"/> Furthermore, the position of the <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfaa6a6de-39e3-4ee6-9254-48a5623c8c6e">two</xref>-winged cherubim in Marienberg fits the description by Ezekiel, as well as the description of the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle, both of which tell how God appeared above the cherubim during the vision (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe970dde4-6752-4d9a-8994-011de95d6b50">Ex 25:22, Ez 10:18, 11:22</xref>).</p>
      <p>In most medieval depictions of the Christ in Majesty, the symbols of the four Evangelists are placed directly around the throne, i.e., in the highest <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://de.pons.eu/englisch-deutsch/hierarchically" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple">hierarchical</ext-link> position. This positioning can be traced to one of the earliest Byzantine models preserved in the mosaics of the Hosios David Church in Salonicco, from the first half of the sixth century, where there are no angels (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDeefbec00-3c97-4c74-b5f7-620c6e139013">Fig. 8</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e243"/> In the Byzantine Egyptian monastery of B&#257;w&#299;t, where a vast variety of early depictions of the Christ in Majesty have been excavated, chapel XVII (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9e34c4a3-66c2-4309-9713-9165976bcbd7">Fig. 9</xref>), which dates only slightly later than the example from Salonicco, includes depictions of two angels worshipping Christ in Majesty directly in-between the symbols of the Evangelist, a variation derived probably from the Book of Daniel, where myriad worshipping angels are mentioned (<xref rid="ID0e3840a3-9682-4457-963d-88c45dbeed50" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb7adc1b2-3d77-413d-87dc-6f16ab9f1f2f">Iacobini 2000, 169</xref>). The Byzantine motif of worshipping angels was adapted in the West, for example in the early ninth century Carolingian murals of M&#252;stair (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe66ea030-e236-4fe7-80d2-4a6faf583242">Fig. 10</xref>), close to Marienberg, where a multitude of angels is on the same level as the four symbols surrounding the throne of the Christ in Majesty.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e249"/> Furthermore, a scene depicting two angels worshipping around the throne is found in twelfth century architecture in South Tyrol, for example in the chapel of the castle of Hocheppan (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6de3055f-c466-4fda-af42-434e82a7a1ae">Steppan 2004, 109 and fig. 3</xref>). Hocheppan is also one of the most prominent examples to demonstrate that, apart from the stylistic features of Byzantine art, multiple motifs of Byzantine origin were also adapted in South Tyrol. For example, the Mary in Majesty with the worshipping angels mentioned earlier adapts a type of depiction which emphasizes the close emotional relationship between mother and child typical in Byzantium from the middle of the twelfth century, and can be compared with the murals of Panhagia Arakiotissa in Cyprus, as Helmut Stampfer and Thomas Steppan have demonstrated convincingly.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e255"/>

      <p>[Fig. 9 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 10 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 11 here]</p>
      <p>The motif of two angels flanking the throne was also varied in Egyptian and Greek Byzantine art from probably the fourth century onwards. In this image, two angels are placed closer to the mandorla and holding it as high as, for example, the symbols in the grotto of the Pantokrator in Herakleia at Lamos (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7fc9d565-8371-48eb-a2ab-32a3fe8aa116">Fig. 11</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e276"/> This holding of the mandorla, sometimes by four angels, can also be found in the West, as in the now lost Tympanon relief of the abbey church of Cluny (<xref rid="ID6c81acde-5f37-454f-b8fb-3fb5e3b32217" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4fe79fc6-c031-4a1c-b1d1-74ed39747188">Fromaget 2003, 24</xref>).</p>
      <p>Marienberg shows a shift in the hierarchy of the angels, the symbols, and their behavior. The symbols of the Evangelists are hierarchically subordinated. In contrast to the Byzantine and Carolingian models, the seraphim and the cherubim<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e285"/> are inserted here, instead, and are not holding the mandorla, but protecting it with their wings. Although reflecting the tradition of Byzantine models which introduced angels around the throne, the Marienberg angels differ from other depictions. Only textual sources can explain their elevated position. As discussed in the next chapter, the definition of the seraphim and the cherubim as the two highest orders of angels was first postulated by the Byzantine author Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.</p>
      <p>The vault of the crypt is painted, too. The four sectroids display thirteen angels in long garments. Their background consists of different bands and triangles and a blue sky with stars (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID002220cd-246f-45fa-b70c-78c653ff185b">Fig. 12</xref>). The sectroids are separated from each other by stylized, meandering cloud patterns that culminate in a painted apex stone in the shape of a flower. The pictorial composition of the northern and southern sectroids has the same background with triangles and similar angels. In the middle, there is a large angel with a lily scepter standing on a platform in front of a green triangle. It is flanked by two other angels of the same height on platforms, also with lily scepters. They turn their heads toward the divine vision in the main apse. Only one angel in the northern sectroid is &#8220;aware&#8221; of the depictions on the western wall, its gaze reinforcing the connection between the two walls and the vault. The angels of the eastern and western sectroid are much smaller, due to the rectangular form of the vault, which affects those sectroids that have an obtuse angle. In the eastern sectroid, there are three angels. The middle one is positioned as an extension of Christ in Majesty and holds an ecclesiastical banner and symbol of power, a labarum, in his hand. In contrast to the other angels of the vault, his head is not directed toward the stone apse, but to the throne. He is accompanied by two other angels with lily scepters in their hands, against a triangular green background. The western sectroid differs the most from the other sectroids (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID40189e21-0086-43c6-8c7c-a12ef1138722">Fig. 13</xref>). It does not have a green triangular background, nor are there platforms for the angels, which seem to hover in the sky. There are four angels instead of three. Three angels, with lily scepters, are directed toward the stone apse, while the fourth seems to be entering the stone apse from a westerly direction, his wings touching the wings of the angel next to him.</p>

      <p>The angels in the vault show iconographical elements and stylistic forms of Byzantine origin that were probably transferred via illuminations from Salzburg from the second half of the twelfth century, as Helmut Stampfer and Thomas Steppan have convincingly suggested. These elements include the bands on the wings and head, the borders on the dresses, and the fluttering ends of the clothes (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID08234c17-ee7c-4b3d-bd9b-e92501bff193">Fig. 15</xref>) (<xref rid="ID4566ed04-e13b-4c16-b8a6-c11ee2a36fa2" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6854fd95-79d3-4ad9-b432-3aa0c0137916">Stampfer and Steppan 2008, 196</xref>). The Byzantine angels of Kurbinovo (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8a93f349-cc6f-48c5-ac54-04b1b04e04ff">Figs. 14a, 14b</xref>), for example, show most of these features, except for the bands on the wings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e310"/> The bands or taenia on the head probably derived from the winged Roman <italic>Victoriae</italic> and the clothes are reminiscent of antique robes (<xref rid="IDbcf58532-6002-423a-a2d0-9f567b82376e" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc6012697-deca-49b1-9023-06378945d86a">Hahn 2010, 84</xref>). The long sticks decorated with the cross as lily scepters on top or the labarum were adapted from Byzantium and can be seen as signs of power. Scepters were already mentioned in the Old Testament where an angel uses a stick in his hand to demonstrate the miraculous power of God (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDea0b5704-1e6d-4703-8b80-3a174af84e4f">Jgs 6:21</xref>), and were also adapted by Pseudo-Dionysius. To him, they were signs of kingdom, God-given power, and leadership (<xref rid="IDbcf58532-6002-423a-a2d0-9f567b82376e" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa652cdc8-7024-458c-9087-bddc4889c7ad">Hahn 2010, 86</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e320"/> Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, introduced the labarum made of purple cloth as a Christian symbol which was adorned with a Christogram.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e326"/>

      <p>The western wall depicts the heavenly Jerusalem (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5910c620-2a37-43b3-882e-068f0c889316">Fig. 16</xref>). The fresco can be divided horizontally into two levels, which are separated from each other by a decorative meander. The lower level consists of a yellow curtain. An old man with a cap and monk&#8217;s habit, probably the Apostle Peter, is shown in the center. He is holding two keys in his right hand. On the upper level, one can see the vision of the heavenly Jerusalem. </p>
      <p>[Fig. 16 here]</p>
      <p>The city here is shown as a town wall with battlements, but the wall has only two sides divided by towers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e348"/> Because the remaining walls that would usually complete the picture of the heavenly city are missing, the space is open to the viewer who is only separated from the city by its upper level and the curtain. Six angels on small platforms populate the city. They face forward, three in front of every mural section. The two groups of three are united by banderoles, again lacking inscriptions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e354"/> Their background consists of a small blue square with a green outline. Next to both sides of the city are the busts of two bishops, who can be identified as such by their clothes&#8212;a miter with hanging bands (Lat. <italic>vitta</italic>) and the chasuble. The bishops hold blank banderoles, too. Their background consists of triangular fields of different colors. The space between the western wall and the heavenly city is divided from the vault by depictions of gems. Precious stones frequently suggest the heavenly Jerusalem, as described in Revelation (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa34ad004-42e9-44e0-9925-e5f190d9a573">Rv 21:19&#8211;20</xref>). In this regard, the angels in the Marienberg crypt are placed in an apocalyptic framework. Their meaning in relation to the Christ in Majesty and the heavenly Jerusalem, as described in Revelation, thus becomes a logical topic for further development.</p>

        <title>Angels in the Book of Revelation</title>
        <p>The New Testament Revelation of John, the last book in the Bible, is one of its most famous and controversial. Around 90 CE, the visionary John wrote down what he described as a vision he had during his exile on the Greek island of Patmos. The author of the text was probably a migrating Christian with a Jewish background, who was moving from the Jewish-Palestinian area to the churches of Asia Minor (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID25d4ee70-29a2-4156-baf4-49feeb85ec8e">M&#252;ller-Fieberg 2003, 40&#8211;41</xref>). In the text, the author describes the end of times as they were relayed to the seven churches of Asia Minor. The first vision of apocalyptic events takes place after John is commissioned to write down the vision and the missive to the churches (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID769b8aa4-b9f6-40bd-99c4-16e19b0834cf">Rv 1:9&#8211;3, 22</xref>). This vision of the throne (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe93452f7-c85a-43de-91a8-7fe85172f995">Rv 4:1&#8211;5, 14</xref>) starts the apocalyptic and destructive events that culminate in the Final Judgment. Together with the vision of the final heavenly Jerusalem (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8f890c1d-6d64-4b64-9dd8-3f0ecc3cc153">Rv 21:1&#8211;22, 5</xref>), which comes down from a new heaven to earth and will be serving God and his people as a new dwelling place, the vision of the throne forms a textual bracket, the beginning and the end, the promise and fulfillment of the apocalyptic events (<xref rid="ID7ff1e795-3fd3-4263-b42d-7afe8ae24142" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1e132c20-a563-4e7a-8dcc-d74c81f1949b">Kretschmar 1985, 35</xref>). Revelation ends with a reiterated speech and warning to the churches (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd74f7b54-1270-4555-9b41-240f0c4be89c">Rv 22:6&#8211;21</xref>) and is deeply rooted in texts of Hebrew origin, such as the visions of Ezekiel, Daniel, and Isaiah (<xref rid="ID87c13b70-8467-4aaa-b731-a5ba1c357800" ref-type="bibr" id="ID484fad30-d9df-4b5c-a2a7-6fe1fbfd33a3">Krauss 2000, 50</xref>), that can be analyzed in connection with angels.</p>
        <p>Revelation tells of angels on earth and in heaven. The scholars Yves Cattin and Philippe Faure called the last book of the New Testament &#8220;The Book of Angels&#8221; (<xref rid="ID731535dd-d7b8-4b75-8ae7-ae4c02dff7e2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb863d03f-1c3f-40f4-b66c-dbccc1a5e39c">Cattin and Faure 2000, 56</xref>) and not without reason. Revelation, according to Johannes Hafer, unites twenty-three different groups of angels (<xref rid="ID774b996b-8622-49ad-942c-0121d3983890" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9b5b52c6-b1fa-493c-845c-7332221436b6">Hafer 2010, 41</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e378"/> With respect to their functions, they can be simplified into eight groups. A first group includes a guiding angel or soul companion that leads John through the divine visions (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6681d1b3-50d5-4d8d-97cf-f6d22809a29a">Rv 1:1, 17:1&#8211;3, 21:9&#8211;10, 21:15&#8211;17, 22:1</xref>). These and other angels also have another function: they are interpreters of the divine message to the visionary (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID34bb5857-e8b9-4030-9579-0185a61a5cc8">Rv 17:7&#8211;18, 19:9&#8211;10, 22:6&#8211;21</xref>). Thirdly, angels appear in the role of guardians of the believers, for example as spirits for the seven churches, or the angels in the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9b928e1d-31ab-4ad8-ac28-b99c355fcea9">Rv 1:4, 1:20, 21:12</xref>). Fourthly, they also take part in the vision of the throne. The seven spirits and the four creatures gather around the throne of God and the lamb and receive the beatific vision and knowledge of God as his entourage (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd39ef37b-889e-4c3b-b937-21ce9e581511">Rv 4:5&#8211;6</xref>). A fifth function can also be attached: they not only partake in the divine vision, but also celebrate the never-ending praise of God with the singing of the Sanctus (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID351e8c85-91f7-4987-b1fd-68b445c9f4b7">Rv 4:8</xref>). This singing or heavenly liturgy is also performed by those angels who are not directly beneath the throne, such as the myriad of angels (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd03b7c7b-1cb9-41e7-938c-8ebc48c6274c">1000 x 1000 angels</xref>), and is reflected in the earthly liturgy, which will be explained in more depth later. The angels&#8217; praise will be repeated frequently until the coming of the heavenly Jerusalem (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID92c05b84-ec42-483b-ade4-b5fcce29b4b6">Rv 5:11&#8211;12, 7:11&#8211;12, 12:12, 15:2&#8211;4, 19:1&#8211;7</xref>). In addition to this task, angels must fulfill a sixth duty by divine order during the apocalypse: They create apocalyptic catastrophes and bring God&#8217;s justice from heaven upon the earth (Rv 8:2, 8:3&#8211;5, 8:6&#8211;13, 9:1&#8211;21, 11:15&#8211;19, 14:17, 14:19&#8211;20, 15:1, 15: 6&#8211;8, 16:1&#8211;20, 18:21&#8211;24, 20:1&#8211;3). Their acts have an immediate effect upon human beings and against evil. The seventh group amongst the angels is that of the angelic warriors of God&#8217;s army, led by the archangel Michael (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID610e4b6f-a9ee-4586-801f-a0dd54bb9e5f">Rv 12:7&#8211;9, 19:14</xref>). An eighth group can be identified as the messenger angels that announce the apocalyptic events or demand them with the intent of advancing further toward the end of times. In contrast to the creators of cosmological disasters, they do not actively partake in the events (Rv 5:2, 7:2&#8211;3, 10:1&#8211;11, 14:6&#8211;12, 14:15, 14:18, 18:1&#8211;3, 18:21&#8211;24, 19:17&#8211;18).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e384"/>
            </p>
        <p>Some of these functions are depicted in Marienberg, where angels can be found partaking of the vision of the throne, performing the heavenly liturgy, and guarding the heavenly city in the murals of the eastern and western walls of the crypt. The angels in the vault do not seem to have a specific biblical function, as they cannot be connected to narrative passages from Revelation. Perhaps they can be seen as cosmological forces and messengers between the two visions, as their position in the vault suggests. </p>
        <p>Revelation is a biblical source for the function of angels in eastern and western Christianity. A Byzantine writer, Pseudo-Dionysius, tried to develop something that went beyond the biblical sources: a hierarchical definition of the angels of high importance to the Latin West.</p>

        <title>Pseudo-Dionysius, the Byzantine liturgy, and their adaption in Western Christianity</title>
        <p>The eastern Christian author Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID108cf5da-24ec-474b-a704-8643443fa6c1">early sixth century</xref>) wrote down an angelic hierarchy in <italic>de caelestis hierarchia</italic> to prove that angels were spiritual beings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e405"/> This text was also widely accepted and adapted in the West. Pseudo-Dionysius drew a picture of the different characteristics and hierarchies of angels, which he divided into nine ranks. Although he relied upon other texts, he was the first to develop a congruent image of the nine orders of the angels. They were separated into three by three triads that were mirrored in the ranks of the church (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID80f3156e-d138-4c71-a64c-1a08632bbcf9">Krauss 2000, 58&#8211;59</xref>). These groups have different levels of access to God and divine knowledge. The highest sphere, or hierarchy&#8212;the one closest to God&#8212;contains the orders of the seraphim, the cherubim, and the thrones. This sphere can see God directly, is more closely aware of his plans than any other, and praises him eternally. The second sphere contains the orders of the dominions, the virtues and the powers and has no access to the divine plan or wisdom, but relays it as a messenger to the lowest sphere. This lowest sphere, which has contact with the world of the human beings and the universe, is made of the principalities, the archangels, and the angels. They annunciate the will of God to human beings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9ac43457-a8d3-4d1d-98bf-ac7c5f7aeb5f">Krauss 2000, 66&#8211;68</xref>). </p>
        <p>This text was widely spread in the West and among almost every exegete there; Gregory the Great (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd1743fd1-87e8-44a8-b8ee-e58e425a4f6a">about 540&#8211;604 CE</xref>) was influenced by it (<xref rid="IDde36db5b-aa11-4b4c-8fd3-985d3c57aeda" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf3b8237e-73a2-4176-9f31-d4ce78e6b252">Frings 2010, 299</xref>) but developed his own hierarchy in the <italic>Moralia in Job,</italic> and in the thirty-fourth <italic>Homilia</italic> of the <italic>Homiliae in evangelia</italic> in comparison with the parable of the tenth drachma, by choosing a different order. The highest hierarchy for him included seraphim and cherubim, followed by the thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, and the virtues, and as the lowest, hierarchically, the archangels and angels. Every human being has an equivalent in one angelic rank, according to one&#8217;s own merit. Gregory&#8217;s concept was the second important angelic model in the Middle Ages (<xref rid="IDe00ab4fb-f310-480b-9ac8-618e963f27ec" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfc96d525-8ce9-4943-94c6-cc91270ba38c">Bruderer-Eichberg 2000, 40</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e426"/> 
            </p>
        <p>In Marienberg, this adaption of Pseudo-Dionysius by Gregory the Great is visible in the two highest ranks of the angels&#8212;the seraphim and cherubim of the apse. The other ranks, however, cannot be deduced from the depictions in Marienberg alone.  </p>
        <p>The texts described above also found their place in the liturgy (<xref rid="IDe00ab4fb-f310-480b-9ac8-618e963f27ec" ref-type="bibr" id="IDff19379a-9018-4da5-b0ad-e8ec8accfd5f">Bruderer-Eichberg 2000, 41</xref>). Celebrating the unification of angels and human beings in the mass was commonly accepted by the church, where the believers sang the <italic>&#192;ghios</italic> in Greek or the <italic>Sanctus </italic>in Latin, both in the Eastern Liturgy of Byzantium, and in the Western Roman Church. The unification between the heavenly and earthly liturgies is mentioned for the first time in Revelation, during John&#8217;s vision of the throne, which takes place in heaven but is made visible to John, who is on the earth. Every being in heaven, on the earth, in the sea, and under the earth partakes in the singing (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbaaca1c0-ec72-43e1-be0f-44e05dc5e53a">Bux 2000, 44 and Geretti 2010, 18&#8211;19</xref>). In the introduction of the Western <italic>Sanctus</italic> in the Roman liturgy, the unification between heaven and Earth in the praising of God is maintained, although one can see the orders as fulfilling different duties (<xref rid="IDdd720052-f0e4-45c9-a9b3-a6ec68b4f4f0" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7e22cd64-048f-4b3b-bbf3-3fdc6dde7a7c">Cabl&#233; 1997, 6</xref>). Angels functioned in the liturgical ceremonies of the funerals as psychopomps for the deceased, thus connecting heaven and Earth, even after their earthly existence ends in the hour of death. This tradition has been handed down by the famous Gallican Antiphon <italic>In Jerusalem deducant te Angeli</italic>, which was sung during funeral processions (<xref rid="ID2fea9584-97ed-4a5d-b463-45ff34f13b88" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7b9ec5b4-06d8-4052-9244-d952ec22d155">Aris 2010, 63&#8211;64</xref>).</p>

        <p rend="ref">In medieval church-architecture, atriums were a space of transfer to the liturgical space.

After the times of church father Augustine of Hippo (<xref rid="ID7f2c9859-84b6-4a0f-ab1f-7680c5d60b4d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID14cba7bd-df82-43c3-99e6-cd5c707ffcd5">354&#8211;430</xref>), there was a system classifying the deceased into four groups.

Thirdly, there were the <italic>non valde mali</italic> who had to stay in purgatory until Judgment Day. Lastly, there were the <italic>valde mali</italic> (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7116c067-66da-4396-843b-f841a5e07aa0">&#8220;the very bad ones&#8221;</xref>) who belonged in hell. Only the martyrs were classified as <italic>valde boni</italic> and went directly to heaven because there was nothing bad in them (<xref rid="IDd0e6abc6-4070-42d9-b06c-00fd924cb7d5" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbb3c76d9-7d2f-4d88-9d5a-a2616dfbdbe1">Angenendt 1994, 68&#8211;69</xref>). These <italic>valde boni </italic>had a prominent place in the altars of the crypt and the upper church of Marienberg and at least two of them were also visible in the window jamb of the main apse and, in this position, served as mediators between the outer space of the atrium and the inner space of the crypt.</p>
        <p rend="ref">Arnold Angenendt has argued in another context that those who considered themselves <italic>non valde mali</italic> often took the atrium as a burial place as an act of humility to the Lord. As an example, Angenendt mentions the atrium of St. Peter in Rome were many popes were buried. He argues that the <italic>non valde mali</italic> who still had to suffer for their sins were understood as standing in front of the door as the <italic>non valde boni</italic> stand in the gates of the heavenly city. The imagery of the <italic>non valde boni</italic> originates in Jewish beliefs and can later be found in the Christian tradition. In Psalm 122, the Jewish pilgrims sung &#8220;Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem.&#8221;Or, in Revelation 22:14, &#8220;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.&#8221; But they were not going there alone. They had heavenly support from angels, a belief which is also reflected in a very famous Gallican oratory for the deceased. The oratory starts with the Latin words: &#8220;<italic>In paradisum deducant te angeli</italic>&#8230;, <italic>perducant te in civitatem Jerusalem</italic>&#8221; (&#8220;Into paradise angels are leading you&#8230; and will conduct you to the holy city of Jerusalem&#8221;). Only after the Final Judgment would such individuals be allowed to fully enter the heavenly city (<xref rid="IDd0e6abc6-4070-42d9-b06c-00fd924cb7d5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4468cb7d-20e6-4843-85d7-c7fbd458935e">Angenendt 1994, 69 and 74</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e527"/>

        <p>The wait before the gates of paradise is pictured next to the northern entrance of the crypt in Marienberg. The souls are guided by an angel to the gates. One angel is awaiting them next to the gates, which in Marienberg are real gates leading to the crypt. This was a common way of depicting angels and the souls of the blessed, as a comparison with the mosaic on the ninth century triumphal arch of Santa Prassede, in Rome, shows. On both gates of the city, angels await the souls who are lead to the city by another angel and the apostles Peter and Paul.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e539"/> The angels in Marienberg lead the faithful to the heavenly city and the sacral space of the crypt. The frescos remind spectators of the souls waiting in the atrium for their heavenly mansion, the patrons of Marienberg. In the atrium of Marienberg, there would have been a direct correspondence between the earthly and heavenly liturgies, the atrium understood as a waiting place in front of heaven, the gate being a threshold to the inner space, with that connection and meaning complemented by the murals. In my opinion, a transitory aspect is also observable in the encrusted curtains with the pilgrim, who is probably Ulrich on his earthly pilgrimage: his preparation for the heavenly city.</p>

        <title>Angels, the Tabernacle, and the Ark of the Covenant</title>
        <p>The two painted curtains in Marienberg emphasize a connection to Old Testament Jewish sources and thoughts. One curtain can be seen in the outer space, and the other on the western wall beneath the depiction of the heavenly Jerusalem, when one when enters the crypt. The multiple curtains and the spatial arrangement in Marienberg probably derived from texts in Hebrew traditions. The Tabernacle, which served as God&#8217;s mobile dwelling place, and which Moses ordered built after the renewal of the Covenant, is a familiar element in Jewish belief and can be found in Exodus (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa1003e31-7f1c-4ff5-880b-bc4b961ea5f8">Ex 11, 25&#8211;31, and 36&#8211;40</xref>). The Tabernacle with the Ark of the Covenant could be entered via an atrium that was kept from the eyes of the believers by curtains on each side. In the inner space of the atrium, one curtain separated the so-called Holy Place from view (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID433ee44c-9f30-47bf-85f3-8b3eca868ec8">Ex 26:36&#8211;37, 36:37&#8211;38</xref>). Inside the Holy Place, was another curtain decorated with cherubim, that separated the Most Holy Place, which contained the Ark of the Covenant, from direct view (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9807d154-5b9c-4781-9117-bf52e0e71f22">Ex 26:31&#8211;33, 36:35</xref>). The covenant was placed in the Ark by Moses himself (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID62da84d0-5ade-4f2b-ae93-1408fe9c36ae">Ex 40:3, 40:21</xref>). The Ark was decorated with two golden cherubim on each end, as protectors, who were poised with open wings, facing both each other and the cover of the Ark (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb480f0bc-7cf2-4fc0-a3b8-40aa0d4f72b5">Ex 37:7&#8211;9</xref>). God told Moses that he would speak to him there between the cherubim and give him his commandments (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID61c3f002-e5cf-44f0-9442-2a1f0527517a">Ex 25:19&#8211;22</xref>). The high priest Aaron and his sons fulfilled their duties in the Tabernacle. Depictions of the Tabernacle can be traced to Jewish art. One famous example that also shows the sequence of the spaces and the curtains is preserved in the synagogue of Dura Europos (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID255ecf97-b164-4865-b453-bfc762679f94">as early as 245 CE</xref>), present-day Syria, where Aaron is shown consecrating the Tabernacle (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID65d5e27f-cc83-42ad-b18d-eb1105faeb53">Fig. 17</xref>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 17 here]</p>
        <p>The spatial arrangement is made very clear. Next to the spectator one can see the walls of the atrium and a loosely draped red and blue curtain at the entrance. The walls are not mentioned in Exodus but are an addition of the artist. One can see Aaron, identified by his clothes and an inscription, in the Atrium, where celebrants play music and sacrifice animals on the altar. Objects such as the golden lampstand, which are normally put in the Holy Place, are taken before it to be consecrated by Aaron. Behind Aaron one sees inside the Holy Place, shown here as temple architecture with colonnades. The curtains in green and red that normally protect it from direct view are drawn aside behind Aaron and the other male figures. The spectator can glimpse something that is normally hidden by elevated red curtains: the Most Holy Place, with the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
        <p>The wish to make Jerusalem God&#8217;s dwelling place was expressed by Nathan and David (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfb578bcf-8689-4971-b389-b992c5dbc26d">2 Sm 7:12&#8211;13</xref>) and later fulfilled by Solomon, who erected the Temple, with the Ark of the Covenant in it, in Jerusalem (<xref rid="ID53a3a66d-1820-44f5-9864-6ef004c3f033" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6237f0b8-260a-4e8b-8fa6-18db36a5e86b">K&#252;hnel 1987, 21</xref>). After the final fall of the second temple in 70 CE, apocalyptic sources of Jewish origin generated a heavenly Jerusalem (<xref rid="ID53a3a66d-1820-44f5-9864-6ef004c3f033" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8c3b1be5-1a54-494d-a145-975f6cb9d0f6">K&#252;hnel 1987, 42</xref>). The notion of a heavenly Jerusalem was adapted by the Christians in Revelation. As God once dwelt in the Tabernacle, he then dwelt with his new chosen people. The Latin word <italic>tabernaculum</italic> was used in the text of Revelation 21:3, as a synonym for the heavenly Jerusalem. The old covenant had been replaced with the new one by the Christians (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7374e6f4-5c95-4bc8-a025-86adca23a555">K&#252;hnel 1987, 56&#8211;57</xref>):</p>
        <p><italic>Ecce tabernaculum&#8230; Dei cum hominibus, et habitavit cum eis; et ipsi populos eius erunt, et ipse Deus cum eis erit eorum Deus</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e570"/></p>
        <p>This connection between the Tabernacle, with the Ark of the Covenant, and the heavenly Jerusalem must have been known to those responsible for building the monastery of Marienberg, given that both of its patrons made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and Jerusalem. In Marienberg, the curtains create a similar spatial arrangement, as per the description of the Tabernacle. A division of three main spaces in the Tabernacle can be found in Exodus: the Atrium, the Holy, and the Most Holy Place which, in Marienberg, are comparable to the atrium, the crypt as the Christian temple, and the depiction of the heavenly Jerusalem. Angels also fit in this arrangement as they are present in both texts. Although their appearance has changed, their function as guardians of the covenant is maintained in the heavenly city.</p>
        <p>The curtain theme was also adapted in Christian exegesis and related to other writings of the New Testament. For example, the tearing of the temple curtain in the hour of Christ&#8217;s death (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0d5d54b3-5b29-4732-8f7d-f5faa0efbd4e">Mt 27:51</xref>) was linked by medieval exegetes to the curtains of the Ark of the Covenant. To Hieronymus (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID56745621-2878-4e31-af9a-dc326b8b08b6">347&#8211;420 CE</xref>), the tearing of the curtain meant the revelation of the secrets of the mundane sphere and history, but it did not mean an entering into the heavenly city as much as waiting in its atrium (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc2a39ca9-6336-4426-ad5a-321faef31823">Spitz 1972, 37&#8211;38</xref>). Augustine altered this view by interpreting Psalm 64:4 as Christ, who, being both High Priest and Lamb at the same time created a door to the Most Holy Place. In Old Testament times, people were separated from the Most Holy Place by the curtain, and only through Christ&#8217;s sacrifice&#8212;the hidden truth&#8212;could the curtain be opened (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd61b786a-4429-43af-969a-4403793cecb2">Spitz 1972, 38&#8211;39</xref>).</p>
        <p>Perhaps this also explains why the curtain in the lower register of the western wall in Marienberg does not hide the heavenly city from the faithful, but exposes it, instead. The believer is now permitted to see the heavenly vision with the angels and is invited to do so by its architecture, which is open to the viewer. This architectural arrangement is strengthened by scripture because the city is no longer hidden from the eyes of the faithful (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID271f7e7a-1e85-42b0-b22c-16e73236be03">Rv 22:3&#8211;4</xref>). Instead of a pilgrim, Peter as guardian holds the keys to the heavenly city. Peter is also reflected in the vision of the Christ in Majesty in Marienberg, where he acts as intercessor for a monk. This interpretation seems plausible because Goswin writes that, during his lifetime, Ulrich was already working toward his reward in heaven by converting, spurning his social rank, wealth, and his family, just like the apostles did. Goswin also explains that Ulrich asked Peter to intercede for his eternal blessing before God (<xref rid="ID98029296-cb25-4261-aace-24b5a4c7f9ed" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe0334c0d-2b5e-4063-81a6-c4d1e8be8c93">Goswin 1996, 102</xref>).</p>

        <title>The angels as role models for the vita angelica</title>
        <p>As one turns around within the crypt, one can see the two heavenly visions from Revelation facing each other: the Christ in Majesty in the apse, and the heavenly Jerusalem, the abode of the blessed, on the opposite side. The angels in the vault represent cosmological forces sent by God in a celestial zone designated by stars that connect the two visions, without taking up some of the narrative elements of the middle part of Revelation. Angels are omnipresent in the two heavenly visions. In the Christ in Majesty, the seraphim and the cherubim are directly experiencing the divine vision and knowledge of God in accordance with the medieval Byzantine tradition, while the Apostles Peter and Paul, the monk, and the martyrs are still awaiting the complete vision of God because of their lower rank in the hierarchy. In the heavenly Jerusalem, they no longer act as pure guardians of the gates and soul companions as seen in the atrium, but populate the heavenly city. The golden cherubim of the Ark of the Covenant have become Christian angels.</p>
        <p>Why was such an explicitly angelological program implemented in Marienberg? After Augustine, Christians were already expected to experience a so-called <italic>vita angelica</italic> on earth<italic>, </italic>in preparation for the afterlife. Monks especially seemed to be able to experience the incorporeal life of the angels because they were expected to live without bodily sins, practice strict asceticism, and devote much of their time to prayer. They longed only to serve the Lord as the angels did in their different ways (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc6de2b99-ed76-4d38-a8c3-2d593e15e618">Krauss 2000, 56&#8211;57</xref>). The crypt of Marienberg was the place where the community celebrated the mass and where the Liturgy of the Hours was held. The community assumed the duty and function of the angels by anticipating their everlasting heavenly liturgy when celebrating the mass. This is a reflection of the Byzantine Pseudo-Dionysian ideas, namely the constant praising of God in the celebration of mass in the earthly liturgy. This idea is a reflection of the heavenly and the beyond in the earthly existence of the monks, an idea that formed an integral part of medieval thinking. But references to angels and their connection to the monks do not end here. Goswin is once again a fruitful source. At the very beginning of the <italic>Registrum,</italic> he speaks to the monks directly and reminds them of their main function, which he sees as their obligation to pray for the deceased. His derivation of the word monk is helpful for a further understanding of the murals:</p>
        <p><italic>Maxime autem religiosi ligati sunt per animabus orandis. Monachi dicti sunt a monos, quod est unum et &#375;cos, quod est custos, quasi custos unius rei videlicet anime</italic> (<xref rid="ID98029296-cb25-4261-aace-24b5a4c7f9ed" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6229d037-1f18-4a43-b6a6-a6e6542b069b">Goswin 1996, 2</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e612"/>
            </p>
        <p>The monks, like angels, can also be understood as protectors and guardians of souls. They fulfill these functions in the earthly world by praying, as a reflection of the angelic guardians in heaven that can be seen in the atrium. The eschatological fulfillment of their constant prayer is found in the crypt: the heavenly Jerusalem is revealed.</p>

Instead of angels the twelve apostles populate the city and the symbols of the Evangelists lift their arms and uphold a circle in which a depiction of Christ as Pantocrator has been inserted. The placement of the latter in the middle of the vault is probably an adaption of the position of the Pantocrator in the cupola of Byzantine churches (Stampfer/Steppan 2008, 258 and fig. 146&#8211;147), which in Matrei has been translated to the heavenly city.</p>
