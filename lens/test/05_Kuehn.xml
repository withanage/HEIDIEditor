      <title>The Dragon in Transcultural Skies: Its Celestial Aspect in the Medieval Islamic World</title>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The dichotomous nature of the dragon is reflected in its chthonic, aquatic, and aerial aspects, allowing it to cross boundaries within its natural environment, metamorphosing from air to land or sea creature and back again, its winged aspect implying an independence from local position and the ability to attain whatever plane of apperception it desires. This quality is revealed in its astral-cosmological, alchemical, astrological, and metaphysical manifestations, glimpses of which can be found in Islamic, Jewish, Christian, and Zoroastrian writings. The intrinsic as well as extrinsic ambiguity of the great beast necessarily entails an element of transcendence, since its mystery can only be explained as flowing from the juxtaposition of two or more levels of reality. Its inherent duality renders the dragon image an embodiment of change and transformation par excellence. Such associations expand its semantic territory as agent of metamorphosis and into the realm of spiritual conceptions.</p>
      <p>A wide semantic range of dragon iconography and iconology evolved during its immemorial history in Western Asia.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e48"/> Animated by an endless interplay of dichotomous forces, the creature revealed itself as deliverer or destroyer, regenerator or annihilator, protector or adversary. The dragon thus served to embody the eternal opposition of two distinct forces, one seeking to preserve life, the other to destroy it, a polarity giving rise to a kaleidoscopic diversity of function and symbolism. Owing to this inherent polyvalence and ambiguity, it has been called &#8220;one of the most complex symbolisms of the history of cultures&#8221; (<xref rid="ID7c76f9e7-523c-454c-878f-645d7ec4c8cf" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5bb23097-34bc-4b70-b009-5fce8b93111f">Le Goff 1980, 162</xref>). Its iconography is a recurring and popular image in the architecture and art of the medieval Islamic world. Yet despite its wide diffusion, the symbolism that survives from medieval Western Asia is often elusive and even cryptic.</p>
      <p>As composite mythical creatures, dragons are endowed with features or parts belonging to various animals generally recognizable across cultural-aesthetic boundaries&#8212;the reptilian, feline, and raptorial motif being prevalent in the overall composition&#8212;and often carry chthonic, aquatic and aerial aspects. Features such as these reveal that the dragon was able to cross boundaries within its natural environment, metamorphosing from air to land or sea creature and back again. The physical changes accompanying such shape-shifting form part of the dragon iconography in medieval Islamic art so that the creature is, for instance, portrayed variously without legs, with two forelegs, or with four legs. Thus a dragon may have a quadruped body, a serpentine body, or a quadruped protome extending into ophidian coils.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e90"/> The avian aspect of the dragon is often expressed through its portrayal with wings, which are associated with the power of flight, a well-known vehicle for the transition from one realm to another.</p>
      <p>In its astral-cosmological manifestation, the dragon necessarily has a celestial quality which is all-powerful, as the sage astrologer J&#257;m&#257;sp relates to Gusht&#257;sp (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd55e4cb9-6218-4119-89d3-17b281cc67ca">Av. Wisht&#257;spa, the Greek Hystaspes</xref>), the Kayanian king of Iranian traditional history and first Mazdaist on the throne:</p>
      <p>No one can safely pass that fateful wheel. Who has by wisdom or by manliness escaped the knife-sharp claws of that celestial dragon? What has to be will be. There is no doubt. The shrewdest man has not escaped his fate.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e105"/>
         </p>
      <p>The early medieval author Mu&#7717;ammad ibn &#703;Abdull&#257;h al-Kis&#257;&#702;&#299;, writing not long before 1200, refers to the authority of Ka&#703;b al-A&#7717;b&#257;r (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID686a69fe-f364-447a-8a97-ff06b9039d12">probably in 17/638</xref>) when portraying the creation of the canopy and the throne of God, which encompasses both Heaven and Earth, and the great serpent that surrounds it:</p>
      <p>Then God created a great serpent to surround the Canopy. Its head is of white pearl and its body is of gold. Its eyes are two sapphires, and no one can comprehend the magnitude of the serpent except God. It has forty thousand wings made of different kinds of jewels, and on each feather there stands an angel holding a jewelled lance, praising God and blessing His name. When this serpent extols God, its exaltation overwhelms that of all angels [...].<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e129"/>
         </p>
      <p>A related description of the girdling serpent-dragon is given by Ab&#363; &#703;Abd All&#257;h al-Qur&#7789;ub&#299;, the thirteenth-century expert in <italic>&#7717;ad&#299;th</italic>, or sacred tradition, in a commentary on <italic>S&#363;ra </italic>40 of the Qur&#702;&#257;n:</p>
      <p>When God created the Throne, it said, &#8220;God has not created anything greater than myself,&#8221; and exulted with joy out of pride. God therefore caused it to be surrounded by a serpent having 70,000 wings, each wing having 70,000 feathers in it, each feather having in it 70,000 faces each face having in it 70,000 mouths, and each mouth having in it 70,000 tongues, with its mouths ejaculating every day the praises of God [&#8230;], the number of drops of rain, the number of leaves of trees, the number of stones and earth, the number of days of this world, and the number of angels&#8212;all these a number of times. The serpent then twisted itself round the Throne which was taken up by only half the serpent while it remained twisted around it. The Throne thereupon became humble.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e161"/>
         </p>
      <p>In the Jewish tradition, a great silver serpent likewise encircles the machinery of the throne of King Solomon and, by operating the wheelwork, activates the mechanism.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e179"/> It is of note that Solomon&#8217;s mechanical throne, which can be likened to a miniature universe, can only be put into motion by the serpent (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6b22b20b-fc2f-4352-afae-c640aebc5192">Jellinek 1967,vol. 2, 83&#8211;85</xref>).</p>
      <p>According to Islamic traditions, the Ka&#703;ba, the most famous sanctuary of Islam, is closely associated with the serpent dragon. In his <italic>Qi&#7779;a&#7779; al-anbiy&#257;&#702; </italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6052ca69-46f8-4ad7-b225-4ad70532486b">&#8220;Tales on the Prophets&#8221;</xref>), Ab&#363; Is&#7717;&#257;q A&#7717;mad ibn Mu&#7717;ammad ibn Ibr&#257;h&#299;m al-Tha&#703;lab&#299; al-N&#299;s&#257;b&#363;r&#299; al-Sh&#257;f&#703;&#299; (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbe1e50f8-3c90-4e81-ba43-2b740f028e26">d. 427/1035</xref>), describes the Ka&#703;ba in Mecca, the central sanctuary of the Islamic world, as a divine throne that is encircled by a dragon:</p>
      <p>Then All&#257;h surrounded it by a serpent. [&#8230;] this serpent wound itself around the throne and the latter reaches to half the height of the serpent which is winding itself around it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e211"/>
         </p>
      <p>Al-&#7788;abar&#299; describes it as:</p>
      <p>[...] a stormy wind with two heads. One of them followed the other till it reached Mecca; there it wound itself like a serpent on the spot of the sacred house.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e254"/> 
         </p>
      <p>The foundation of the Ka&#703;ba is further described as:</p>
      <p>[...] a wind called the wind Al-Khadj&#363;dj which had two wings and a head like a serpent&#8217;s.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e284"/> 
         </p>
      <p>A similar description is given by &#7716;usayn ibn Mu&#7717;ammad al-Diy&#257;rbakr&#299; in his <italic>Ta&#702;r&#299;kh al-kham&#299;s</italic>,in which the foundation is said to possess: </p>
      <p>[...] two serpents&#8217; heads, one behind the other.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e316"/>
         </p>
      <p>Such traditions endow the great serpent with a sacred as well as mythological character. Its supernatural qualities are manifest in its winged and double-headed appearance. Even more significantly, as Arent Jan Wensinck points out, the Meccan serpent is either the Sak&#299;na or a being sent by God in most traditions, and is hence &#8220;not a demoniac but a divine being.&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e330"/>
         </p>
      <p>The iconography of the encircling dragon, traditionally known by its Greek name <italic>Ouroboros</italic>, was thus known in the Islamic tradition and its imagery vividly described in surviving textual sources. The symbolism is also evident in the visual heritage; it appears on portable artefacts, such as in manuscript illustrations, as well as in sculptural and architectural elements.</p>

         </p>
      <p>It is significant that, in medieval Islamic iconography, the <italic>Ouroboros </italic>dragon was doubled<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e451"/> and often pictured as two entwined dragons eating one another (or, in other words, threatening and &#8220;devouring,&#8221; as well as &#8220;delivering&#8221; and protecting one another). In an act simultaneously self-destructive and parturient, the cycle is recreated in the self-devouring. </p>
      <p>The motif appears on a carved wooden door, once possibly part of a mausoleum (<xref rid="IDc6386db0-26a8-4a7d-a6ed-1173bb804712" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc1549bc6-9afd-4d99-813d-f9424df1e935">Hauptmann von Gladiss 2006, 95</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfdfb40e5-6356-4812-b0a6-6487db620f6d">Fig. 2</xref>). The door, dated to the first half of the thirteenth century is thought to come from the Tigris region, and is now preserved in the Museum f&#252;r Islamische Kunst in Berlin (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4df27306-9315-4c08-87f2-1ce200dfcf4a">Meinecke 1989, 54, 58, detail</xref>). It is carved with a pair of large dragons surrounding a central medallion set within an arch-shaped frame. The latter contains an interlaced infinite star pattern, outlined by an interlaced pearled band which extends at its apex to a small medallion. The medallion is touched on either side by the sinuous tongues projecting from the gaping mouths of the dragons whose scaly, serpentine bodies with raised slender wings wind tightly around the medallion. Their bodies form a heart-shaped knot and two loops, the ends of their tails tapering to a point to form a tight curl at the base. Due to the surface wear of the door, only the frame of the small medallion is extant, so one can only speculate what it was that the dragons were protecting or threatening.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 1 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 2 here]</p>
      <p>A similar concept dominates the depiction on a large bas-relief stone fragment carved with a pair of antithetically arranged dragons framing concentrically arranged, patterned circles that carry clear solar associations. Discovered near Alaeddin Tepe in Konya, now in the &#304;nce Minare Muzesi in Konya (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa895e9f5-a371-407b-a86c-63c89b19365c">Fig. 3</xref>), the medallion was probably part of a thirteenth-century Saljuqid monument which no longer exists. Only the head of the dragon on the left is complete, portrayed with a long, curved snout and wide-open mouth, revealing sharp teeth and fangs and a prominent, sinuous tongue, the tip of which touches the edge of the star rosette. The head is punctuated with almond-shaped eyes framed by long, curved lashes and crowned by a small, rounded ear. At the back of the head, the dragon&#8217;s neck is clasped by paired &#8220;collars,&#8221; the upper part braided, the lower marked with vertical hatching. The dragons&#8217; long, scaly ophidian bodies form a loop and then a pretzel-like knot. The bottom section of the stone is broken off, so the tips of their tails are lost. Likewise, only part of the pretzel-like knot of the dragon on the right&#8217;s body has survived.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 3 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 4 here]</p>
      <p>The dragon&#8217;s <italic>ouroboros </italic>aspect is further evident in the double frontispiece of the <italic>Kit&#257;b al-diry&#257;q</italic> (&#8220;Book of the Theriac,&#8221; often referred to as &#8220;Book of Antidotes&#8221;), dated 595/1199, in the collection of the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale, Paris, on which the encircling dragons are juxtaposed with the personification of the Moon (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID94875495-e3b7-4411-bb4e-8cf75a96e92f">Fig. 4</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e515"/> Although of course realised in an entirely different medium, the representations in stone and on paper probably share a relatively close geographic provenance and period of production. The astral personification on the Pseudo-Galen double frontispiece, moreover, might provide a link between what appear to be composite stellar symbols on the Berlin door (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa19a2eaa-c5e0-4df7-ab48-80e07185ebd2">Fig. 2</xref>) and the Konya architectural stone fragment (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3447d7f4-e98d-4ad7-9aa8-5dd0856cf513">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>The dragon&#8217;s manifestly dual nature confers it an intermediate status. The world encircling <italic>Ouroboros </italic>marks the boundary between the ordered world and the chaos around it and thereby appears as an exponent of liminality situated upon the ambiguous dividing line between the divine and the demonic. Thus intrinsically linked with the idea of the threshold, dragon imagery appears around openings and entry points of secular and religious architectural monuments, where it serves as a liminal marker and apotropaic device in the role of a guardian imbued with protective and talismanic power, warding off the dangers and inimical forces inherent to such places.</p>
      <p>In the discussion of the story of primordial Paradise in post-Qur&#702;&#257;nic canonical traditions, the serpent dragon&#8217;s inherent ambivalence is also expressed: Before the expulsion from Paradise, the Genesis serpent is described as a winged creature with legs. Such a giant winged quadruped serpent is portrayed, for instance, in the wall paintings showing events related to the book of Genesis on the drum of the dome in the Armenian palatine church of the Holy Cross at Aght&#703;amar on Lake Van (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID225fbaea-e4df-44eb-a7c9-88219b7b024a">now in Eastern Turkey</xref>), built between 915 and 921 (<xref rid="ID5faa008b-0638-4d6b-baed-a6f20e046d81" ref-type="bibr" id="IDce482124-b114-41b2-9801-be7049383364">Mathews 1982, 245&#8211;257</xref>; <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID72d5c895-0ce5-47c1-bb42-44dc6fa122d1">Thierry 1987, 384, Fig. 266</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID13d78861-c498-408d-a911-6940b99ca2ec">Fig. 5</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e557"/> In Islamic lore, the serpent is described as the most beautiful and strongest of animals:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e578"/>
         </p>
      <p>The serpent was shaped like a camel and like the camel, could stand erect. She had a multi-coloured tail, red, yellow, green, white, black, a mane of pearl, hair of topaz, eyes like the planets Venus and Jupiter, and an aroma like musk blended with ambergris. Her dwelling was in the aqueous Paradise, and her pond was on the shore of the River Cawthar. Her food was saffron, and she drank from that river; and her speech was exaltation of God, the Lord of the Universe. God had created her two thousand years before he created Adam, and she had told Adam and Eve about every tree in Paradise.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e596"/>

      <p>The dragon in Zoroastrianism, the religion of ancient Iran, also experienced a &#8220;fall from grace&#8221;. A decisive change in the iconology of the dragon was brought about by the rise of a rigid Zoroastrian cosmological dualism. A more robust symbolism was needed and the serpent-dragon accrued a range of negative aspects. The Zoroastrian evil principle of the universe, Angra Mainyu, known in later times as Ahriman, is likened to the serpent in the <italic>Great Bundahishn </italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf358835d-68db-4249-9893-47c28ecff32b">&#8220;Book of Primal Creation&#8221;</xref>)&#8212;Pahlaw&#299; translations based on lost Avestan scriptures of the third century CE and earlier, and their commentaries written after the Arab conquest (<xref rid="ID607baa22-3225-4a19-ba5e-6a9f511e5a53" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8b145ccf-523d-4133-9b39-eadbd551ecea">Watkins 1995, 58</xref>). The<italic> Great Bundahishn</italic> describes him as having sprung: </p>
      <p>[&#8230;] like a snake, out of the sky down to the earth&#8230; thereby the sky was as shattered and frightened by him, as a sheep by a wolf.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e717"/>
         </p>
      <p>The inherently powerful and combative serpent-dragon aptly came to represent the Zoroastrian evil spirit who declares to God: </p>
      <p>I shall destroy you and your creatures forever and ever. And I shall persuade all your creatures to hate you and to love me.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e744"/> 
         </p>
      <p>At the same time, it has to be pointed out that in spite of the negative associations brought about by Zoroastrian cosmological dualism, the Greek writer Philo of Byblos (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcae37e4b-22b0-4ecb-b3e3-d0e951d991c0">ca. 64&#8211;141 AD</xref>) records a saying attributed to the magus Zoroaster, according to whom the serpent is not only immortal but: </p>
      <p>[&#8230;] the director of everything beautiful [&#8230;] the best of the good, the wisest of the wise [&#8230;] the father of order and justice, self-taught [&#8230;] and perfect and wise [&#8230;].<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e762"/> 
         </p>
      <p>The link between these statements and historical Iranian Zoroastrianism seems tenuous. Nevertheless, in addition to reflecting the Hellenistic reception of Zoroastrian ideas, these passages may suggest that the Iranian definition of the serpent dragon as unequivocally maleficent was perhaps not always as cut and dried as it appears from surviving scriptures.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e788"/>
         </p>
      <p>Hence in its new guise&#8212;that is, after the rise of Zoroastrian cosmological dualist notions&#8212;the dragon assumed the mantle of eschatological opponent, the evil principle who would be destroyed, following a millennium of conflict, in a final battle that would usher in a new age and a new creation. Serpents and dragons thereby came to be classified as noxious beings <italic>(khrafstra</italic>s<italic>), </italic>creatures of Ahriman, the Zoroastrian evil principle of the universe and, as such, evil and deserving of death.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e830"/> 
         </p>
      <p>Astrology also offered support for Zoroastrian apocalyptic ideas, according to which the planetary bodies were regarded as evil. The &#8220;good&#8221; luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, were removed from the category of the seven planets, whose intrusion brought injustice into the world (<xref rid="ID0cb3f837-39b3-47a6-a728-ffe7c9a57105" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6d91c18c-db58-4d41-ae83-b69a36b389d6">Khareghat 1914, 129</xref>; Brunner, &#8220;Astronomy and Astrology in the Sasanian Period, s.v. Astrology and Astronomy in Iran,&#8221; <italic>EIr</italic>). Consequently, the Sun and the Moon were substituted by two &#8220;demonic&#8221; opponents, the head and tail of the dragon (Pahl. <italic>G&#333;chihr </italic>which stems from the Avestan <italic>gao chithra</italic>, &#8220;holding the seed of cattle,&#8221; formerly the stock epithet of the Moon<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e883"/>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e899"/> According to the <italic>Bundahishn</italic>, G&#333;chihr is portrayed as &#8220;similar to a snake with the head in Gemini <italic>(d&#363;-pahikar</italic>, the twins<italic>) </italic>and the tail in Centaurus <italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDef680c70-44f6-4be6-8654-c83965de993f">n&#275;masp</xref>)</italic>, so that at all times there are six constellations between its head and tail.&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e939"/>
         </p>
      <p>The idea that these phenomena were caused by a body whose head and tail intercepted the Sun and Moon&#8217;s light was probably related to the emergence of definite ideas as to the nature of the orbits of the Sun and the Moon and their opposite points of intersection between the Moon&#8217;s orbit and the ecliptic (<xref rid="ID0cb3f837-39b3-47a6-a728-ffe7c9a57105" ref-type="bibr" id="ID26088303-6f8f-4fe5-8978-79ce61577db7">Khareghat 1914, 129</xref>). The classical theory of the dragon myth seems to have been modified in accordance with developments in astrological doctrine from late Arsacid and Sasanian times onwards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e959"/> Sasanian astrologers received the notion of R&#257;hu, a celestial serpent whose head <italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5a47f760-e4b8-4a8f-a949-3c1b86ee7fec">siras</xref>) </italic>and tail <italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID39ce4d9b-356d-4842-86fd-2e5ab9687231">ketu</xref>) </italic>cause solar and lunar eclipses, from India.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1022"/> In Pahlaw&#299;, R&#257;hu was referred to as G&#333;chihr.

This image is featured on an inlaid copper-alloy inkwell of the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, which depicts a cross-legged figure crowned by a pointed headdress and flanked by dragon-headed staves. The dragons have gaping mouths with particularly long tongues, oriented towards the figure&#8217;s head. Importantly, the dragons&#8217; undulant bodies descend diagonally from the staves and thus directly associate the depiction with the entire body of the dragon; the latter representing an abbreviated reference to the astrological &#8220;head&#8221; <italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3dbc5031-3990-4198-9907-2645c9b52f13">ra&#702;s</xref>) </italic>and the &#8220;tail&#8221; <italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe8d36c1a-3d38-4ea1-a191-51b87af6d38f">dhanab</xref>) </italic>of the dragon.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1394"/>

      <p>While the dragon is often associated with eclipses and, hence, the &#8220;devouring of light,&#8221; its positive aspect as giver of light and, consequently, as protector of light is more difficult to gauge, although numerous references are found in poetry and in Iranian works in particular. The polymath Asad&#299; &#7788;&#363;s&#299; writes accordingly in his epic <italic>Garsh&#257;sp-n&#257;ma:</italic>

      <p>A double-headed celestial dragon is evoked in the description of the Persian poet Kam&#257;l al-D&#299;n Abu &#8217;l-&#703;A&#7789;a&#702; Ma&#7717;m&#363;d ibn &#703;Al&#299; Kh&#695;&#257;j&#363; Kirm&#257;n&#299; (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID38127ad9-b669-4b71-9fd9-6e8cc74d2c69">689/1290&#8211;753/1352</xref>):</p>
      <p>Two-branched head like two branches of a tree,</p>

         </p>
      <p>The east-west aspect of the bipartite dragon and its light symbolism is further evoked in a passage of the fables and anecdotes of the early thirteenth-century <italic>Marzub&#257;n-n&#257;ma</italic>,with the allegorical allusion:</p>
      <p>At dawn, when the black snake of night casts the sun&#8217;s disc out of the mouth of the east [&#8230;].<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1595"/>
         </p>
      <p>This passage once again implies a double-headed dragon delivering the luminary and creating the light.</p>
      <p>The paired and dualistic aspects of the dragon, for instance his beneficent/destructive or light/dark aspects, which represent a fundamental polarity on which the cosmic rhythm is based, are affirmed by &#7788;ars&#363;s&#299;&#8217;s twelfth-century compilation of prose narratives, the <italic>D&#257;r&#257;b-n&#257;ma</italic>. He describes the following episode that happened to the hero:</p>
      <p>&#7788;amr&#363;siyeh, while deep in thought, saw a snake as white as milk with two wings on its sides &#8230; and a human face &#8230; An hour passed and he saw another snake similar to the first one but black as the wings of a crow &#8230;. &#7788;amr&#363;siyeh said: &#8220;The black snake should not be allowed to kill the white snake.&#8221; So hurriedly he awoke the white snake and when the white snake saw the black one they began to battle &#8230;. &#7788;amr&#363;siyeh rushed [into the fracas], took a large rock and hit the black snake on the head and killed it ... the large snake &#8230; then disappeared. [Later] two snakes appeared and greeted &#7788;amr&#363;siyeh and paid homage to him. They said, &#8220;The white snake was our offspring and God Almighty made you victorious. You aided our son and killed that demon.&#8221; </p>
      <p>&#7788;amr&#363;siyeh retorted, &#8220;What kind of creatures are you and which [tribe] do you come from?&#8221; The snakes answered, &#8220;We belong to the angels [<italic>par&#299;y&#257;n</italic>] but the black snake was a demon [<italic>d&#299;v</italic>] and they live behind the mountains and raise their heads above it &#8230;. These are not dragons but demons who make themselves look like dragons.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1651"/>
         </p>
      <p>This account seems to access a very deep substratum in that it confirms the existence of angelic and celestial dragons vis-&#224;-vis demonic and ecliptic dragons. It also shows the inherent ambivalence of the great dragon beast, its white versus black attributes (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb0c44f01-0a4f-477f-a6c1-006866525bd9">or light against darkness</xref>), and its delivering versus devouring aspects. This conceptual pairing of opposites is also reflected in the symmetrically doubled dragons, in other words by their paired portrayal, on the architectural compositions discussed below.</p>
      <p>The esoteric conceptualisation of the cosmic dragon is illuminated in the allegory of a hero&#8217;s spiritual journey in <italic>A Tale of Occidental Exile, </italic>written by the mystic Shih&#257;b al-D&#299;n Ya&#7717;y&#257; Suhraward&#299; (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdc5e126d-2ebd-4496-9289-e8dd5ebc60ad">d. 587/1191</xref>):</p>

      <p>The celestial association of the dragon is alluded to in one of the monumental entrance gates to the citadel of Aleppo, which was legendary for its impregnability. A pair of monumental, intertwined double-headed dragons tops the entrance gate (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe238bcc8-b55d-4bef-af1b-0f50f364336f">Figs. 7a and 7b</xref>). A large, relief-carved frieze with interlaced dragons surmounts a pointed archivolt with a raised frame at the main portal known as &#8220;Serpent Gate&#8221; (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID12770ddb-a0cf-4127-99c4-63d3f3648960">B&#257;b al-&#7716;ayy&#257;t, re-built probably around 606/1209&#8211;10</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1790"/> at the eastern tower of the citadel, which was rebuilt under the Ayyubid ruler al-Malik al-&#7826;&#257;hir ibn Sal&#257;&#7717; al-D&#299;n (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd7b43655-6f00-4b77-95a7-81534dba4328">568/1173&#8211;613/1216</xref>). Their two heads, one at the spring of the arch and two at the apex, are crowned by a pair of cusped ears and punctuated with small, round eyes; their pointed snouts reveal a row of prominent, pointed teeth with bifid tongues thrusting out. Scaly, ruff-like collars from which project what appear to be tiny, upswept, cusped wings accentuate the base of their necks and delineate their bodies. Their slender, serpentine bodies are thrice knotted on either side into evenly spaced, pretzel-like shapes. Their entwined necks at the apex result in an addorsed position of the dragon heads that, with their wide-open jaws, appear to grasp or attack their bodies; this configuration is mirrored in the lower necks and heads of the dragons at the tail tips, which are twisted around roundels enclosing eight-pointed star rosettes, which Willy Hartner has interpreted as solar symbols (<xref rid="ID8af0fa4a-a854-42a1-ae74-4fcb323bcc54" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdfc11252-5380-4999-b64e-1e430d64d26e">Hartner 1934, 144</xref>).</p>
      <p>A similar notion is conveyed on the small &#8220;Kiosk Mosque&#8221; situated in the arcaded rectangular courtyard of the double-section caravanserai Sultan Han, located northeast of Kayseri, on the main road that once linked Konya, Kayseri and Sivas to the east (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID21c1b635-ea9b-4555-9dd7-955c86c595cb">Iraq and Iran</xref>). It is the second largest Saljuq caravanserai in Anatolia and was built between 629/1232 and 633/1236, on the orders of &#703;Al&#257;&#702; al-D&#299;n Kay Qub&#257;dh I of Konya, as attested by an inscription on the portal. Resting on a four-bay substructure, both the south- and east-facing monumental ogival arches are symmetrically framed with a complex serpentine festoon. The latter is composed of reciprocally arranged pretzel-like shapes, culminating at the apex in confronted dragon protomes. Their heads, with large, almond-shaped eyes, topped by backward-projecting pointed ears, have wide-open jaws revealing tongues and sharp teeth (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd1accbb1-3308-4596-a5a0-eacbb33ce4c3">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Both the south- and east-facing reliefs are closely related but, while the dragon protomes on the south side do not touch each other at the apex, the protomes on the east side are joined and enlivened by dots (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3f61b4bf-c4ce-4776-ba51-c8b4b3004214">&#214;ney 1969, Figs. 6, 7</xref>; <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb356d0a2-5737-4dc8-9c89-aea72c37d036">Gierlichs 1996, pls. 6.1, 2</xref>). Moreover, on the south-facing arch, the dragon festoons end in small, inverted dragon heads with large eyes, necks bent inwards, and open jaws that appear to hold the tip of the outer edge of the festoon band.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1827"/> It is thus interesting to observe that they seem to bite (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb3971893-d4b1-4863-ba10-7d67c77c0c5c">in other words simultaneously &#8220;swallow&#8221; and &#8220;disgorge&#8221;</xref>) their own tails. While this feature is not recognisable on the east-facing arch (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID79d4841f-6886-45a9-a883-3e3361091ca4">possibly due to surface deterioration</xref>), it shows, interestingly, an additional small, upward-oriented dragon head, growing out of one of the bends of the dragon festoon to the left.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1836"/> Also of note is the fact that both serpentine festoons are surmounted by a further band enclosing a tightly-woven knotted composition distinguished by a small eight-petalled star rosette in the interstitial area at the apex (although on the east side, this is no longer identifiable due to surface deterioration). Katharina Otto-Dorn has interpreted the rosette as a planetary symbol suggesting an astral-mythological reading of the iconography (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdc8c1755-b512-47b0-81c5-9436b7b89a3d">1978&#8211;79, 130f, fig. 24</xref>).</p>

      <p>A closely related Saljuq dragon sculpture can be found on the now partly destroyed thirteenth-century caravanserai, Susuz Han (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa1bc4925-13bd-4c61-b171-674b29cac993">Susuz Kh&#257;n</xref>), dated ca. 644/1246, located about one kilometre south of Bucak, just off the Burdur-Antalya road. Here the ogives of a pair of recessed <italic>muqarnas </italic>niches that flank the portal are each surmounted by a pair of antithetically presented dragons in profile (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7b60d59f-7870-4bf0-a032-882a1129a954">Fig. 9</xref>). The heads of the mythical creatures are crowned by curved horns. They have elongated snouts that end in curled-up tips and their mouths are wide-open. Their sinuous necks are covered with scales and from their protomes project curved wings and short forelegs. At the apex, the confronting dragon mouths flank a small, rounded human head with clearly demarcated eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. The dragons&#8217; stylised festooned tails, which echo the contemporary festoon on the arches of the &#8220;Kiosk Mosque&#8221; at Sultan Han, frames the entire arch (without however ending in a second head at the tail tip, as on the south-facing ogive arch at Sultan Han). The composition is further distinguished by a pair of winged figures that flank a central, now destroyed, motif. These figures seem to hover protectively over the composition and can be assumed to have celestial significance. Their presence seems to bestow an honorific dimension upon the enigmatic iconography of the mask-like human heads tightly enclosed by the dragons&#8217; gaping jaws.</p>
      <p>A pair of monumental antithetical dragons are depicted on a deeply-carved relief band at the back of the entrance <italic>&#299;w&#257;n </italic>at Karatay Han, on the former trade road linking Kayseri with Malatya, built during the reign of <italic>Sul&#7789;&#257;n </italic>Ghiy&#257;th al-D&#299;n Kay Khusraw II in 638/1240&#8211;1. Their expansive serpentine bodies, entirely stylised by three parallel moulded bands, form a horizontal guilloche, which extends to frame the entire arch and interlaces at the apex to form a central circular motif, presumably alluding to stellar symbolism (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID16346d84-cd14-4c77-bd9d-9379d2011e19">Figs. 10a and 10b</xref>). Tongues with bifid tips touch the edges of the central motif, projecting from the toothed jaws of the substantial dragon heads which are finely carved in profile with slightly gaping mouths and long, wrinkled snouts, the tips terminating in a tight curl. Their heads have small, almond-shaped eyes and their cheeks are enlivened by fine spiralling motifs. A pair of cusped ears crowns their heads; their manes swept back and covering the uppermost section of their finely carved, scaly necks.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1883"/>

      <p>The pairing of the dragons, aimed at buttressing and doubling the visual impact, was a noticeable feature that may have served to both augment and reinforce the symbol&#8217;s potency. The cult of heaven <italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf9abc105-dd33-4ca5-af5a-225ce23e3ce8">t&#228;&#241;ri</xref>)</italic> was central to the ancient Turko-Mongol system of belief, its beginnings going back to ancient times. The belief system played a fundamental role not only in the notions of legitimacy and sovereignty (<xref rid="ID33d8b2c2-2f2a-49e5-950f-b64d3a28af5c" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9ae38f4c-3ce7-486f-bb1e-fc3bfbabd3cc">Spuler 1939, repr. 1955, 168&#8211;9</xref>),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1921"/> but comprised the veneration of the sun, in particular the rising sun, the moon, and the natural phenomena of the heavens in which the belief in a dragon also played an important role.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1939"/> The inherently ambivalent aspect of the great beast is also mirrored in ancient Turkish cosmology, which saw the creature living underground in winter, then reappearing in the spring and soaring into the sky in the summer, where it reigned at the zenith as a divine creature (Boratav, &#8220;Drache.&#8221; <italic>WdM</italic>, 207).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1981"/> It may thus be suggested with a degree of certainty that the double dragon featured above or next to archways alludes to the heavenly spheres and the diurnal cycle of the light of day followed by the darkness of night.</p>
      <p>At this juncture, it is important to emphasise that the intrinsic as well as extrinsic ambiguity of the serpent dragon also entails an element of transcendence, necessarily so since the creature&#8217;s mystery can only be explained as flowing from the juxtaposition of two or more levels of reality. In essence, then, the dragon defies understanding. The cosmic aspect of the dragon also involves a sacred dimension; it is interesting to note that the Latin term <italic>sacer </italic>means both sacred and wretched or cursed. Its inherent duality makes the dragon image an embodiment of change and transformationpar excellence. Such associations extend the dragon&#8217;s semantic territory as agent of metamorphosis into the realm of spiritual conception. Further, the great beast serves as metaphor for spiritual realities whose meanings are obscured or veiled.</p>
      <p>In his short tractate entitled <italic>Sod ha-Nachasch u-Mischpato </italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0be9f8f7-08b9-45df-a3ac-1af2f8156f0c">&#8220;Mystery of the Serpent&#8221;</xref>), thethirteenth-century cabalist, Joseph Gikatilla ben Abraham, a disciple of the Spanish mysticAbraham ben Samuel Abulafia (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4e062006-58f4-4938-ac84-422ff1790efa">1240&#8211;ca. 1292</xref>),shed some light on the mystery of the mythicalcreature as a liminal symbol, situated upon theambiguous dividing line between the divine andthe demonic:</p>
      <p>Know that from the outset of its creation the serpent represented something important and necessary for harmony so long as it stood in its place. It was the Great Serpent who had been created to carry the yoke of both sovereignty and service. Its head surmounted the heights of the earth and its tail reached into the depths of hell.</p>
      <p>Yet in all worlds it had a befitting place and represented something extraordinarily significant for the harmony of all stages, each one in its place.</p>
      <p>And this is the secret of the serpent of heaven that is known from the <italic>Sefer Yezira</italic>, and that sets in motion the spheres and their cycle from east to west and from north to south. And without it no creature in the sublunar world had life, and there would be no sowing and no growth and no motivation for the reproduction of all creatures.</p>
      <p>This serpent now stood originally outside the walls of the sacred precincts and was connected from the outside with the outer wall, since its tail was linked with the wall whereas its countenance was oriented inwards. It did not befit it to enter the inside, but its place and law was to affect the creation of growth and reproduction from the outside, and this is the secret of the tree and the knowledge of good and evil.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2085"/>
         </p>
      <p>Finally, it is important to recall the significance accorded to the great serpent in the legendary Islamicised prophetic tales, based on the authority of learned men from the early years of Islam but recorded only from the eleventh century onwards. Related by the <italic>qu&#7779;&#7779;&#257;&#7779; al-&#703;&#257;mm </italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4d6823df-d9c6-46e4-9e93-c59407d87b14">&#8220;narrators for the common folk&#8221;</xref>), who enjoyed great success with popular audiences, the tales reveal the extraordinary aura that surrounded the fabulous beast. Not only was the great serpent said to encircle the divine canopy, but it was singled out to:</p>
      <p>&#8230; greet [the] Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad on the night of his ascent into heaven and give him glad tidings concerning himself and the community.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2108"/>

        <p>	 The iconography of the dragon is the topic of my Ph.D. thesis, published in revised form (Kuehn 2011). While it discusses different qualities of the great beast, its aerial or celestial aspect has proved to be the most elusive and was not considered in as much detail as it deserves&#8212;a lacuna which the present paper attempts to address. The composite mythical animal commonly identified as <italic>s&#275;nmurv</italic>, which has wings and a (pea)cock-like tail (associating it with the motif of flight) is the subject of a detailed investigation in Kuehn, <italic>Ancient Iconography in Western Asia: The Image of the Dragon from 2500 BC TO 650 AD</italic>, forthcoming.</p>

The practice probably goes ultimately back to the Mesopotamian world (Panaino 2004, 2005), since the heavenly bodies follow patterns that are comparable to Babylonian hemerologies. Cf. Zaehner 1972, 107&#8211;9).</p>

        <p>	 The iconography is entirely absent from Western Central Asian monumental art until the fifteenth century, when it first appeared on the portal of Abu &#8217;l-Q&#257;sim Babur&#8217;s mosque dating from 848/1444&#8211;5, situated in the shrine complex of Jam&#257;l al-&#7716;aqq wa &#8217;l-D&#299;n at Anau near Ashgabat in Turkmenistan, which was destroyed when the area was struck by an earthquake in 1948. There, two symmetrical large yellow dragons set against a blue background in mosaic faience were depicted in the tympanum of the portal arch. Some of the dragon mosaic has been recovered and is now housed at the Fine Arts Museum of Ashgabat. The portal was photographed by the German art historian Ernst Cohn-Wiener in the 1920s, whose collection of photographs taken in west Turkestan is kept at the British Museum and published online in the digital library of archnet.org; ArchNet Image ID ICW0120. For a discussion of the Anau dragon motif, see Pugachenkova 1956, 125&#8211;9.
