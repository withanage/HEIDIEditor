      <title>Ethereal Imagery: Symbolic Attributes in&#160;the Art and Architecture of India</title>

        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Since religious beliefs have long been the foundation of a community&#8217;s way of life in India, these beliefs were adopted in all expressions of both temple and domestic architecture. The environment thus reflected the cultural traits of the people. With the help of selected examples from Ahmadabad&#8217;s early nineteenth and twentieth century history, this text introduces the presence of ethereal, winged half divinities as an important aspect of architectural and sculptural details in Indian religious architecture. In the second half of the nineteenth century, such forms finally emerged as a result of the entanglement between local and imported Western art forms. European art and imagery thus became identified with the taste and preferences of the colonial state.</p>

        <title>Belief in ethereal existence</title>
        <p>Symbolic attributes in the art of all cultures emerge from a desire to represent their inherent philosophical thoughts and ideas. They may permeate human existence on a metaphysical plane, through spirituality, harbouring a belief in ethereal existence. Physical and metaphysical existence are both part of a people&#8217;s cultural beliefs. They are vividly expressed in representational expressions to convey the story of mankind and our spiritual beliefs, which supposedly connect us to the ethereal sphere and its heavenly spirits. The desire to convey these meanings and beliefs in their totality produces varied forms of visual imagery and is conveyed through various symbolic themes and images. These images and themes become important attributes in sculpture and painting. The form represents an entity of unique completeness, conveying all aspects of the philosophical beliefs. This conveyance is the main object in representational arts.</p>
        <p>Ethereal imagery may thus be an important attribute in artistic compositions. It raises human aspirations and thoughts, lifting the mind to thoughts beyond the mundane world, while allowing it to concentrate on worship. For this reason, these images are seen as an inspiring extension of the human mind&#8217;s ability to harbour thoughts about <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc90170fb-f4be-4b25-bf86-d7bc8f187a9a">spiritual</xref> life as the highest level of human existence. In Indian art and architecture, the ethereal images may be depicted as figurative symbols that may be the subjects of all kinds of artistic expressions like music, poetry, painting, and sculpture, the supposed conveyers of states of higher thoughts: divine celestial musicians, <italic>gandharva</italic>; divine preachers, <italic>vidy&#257;dhara</italic>&#8212;literally &#8220;wisdom-bearer&#8221;&#8212;small garland bearers who fly above the head of a god, while the garland symbolises the attainment of supreme (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0fe1a631-3253-44db-ab10-abee70301921">spiritual</xref>) wisdom; divine beings, <italic>kinnara</italic>&#8212;celestial musicians possibly related to the&#160;<italic>gandharva</italic> who have the heads of men and the bodies of birds or horses. <italic>Kimpuru&#7779;a </italic>are also from the family of similar ethereal forms. The presence of divine figures in representational arts and architecture infuses in the minds of the worshippers a sense of sacred union while celestial imagery forms part of the belief in higher realms of consciousness. In any case, it must be realised&#8212;in connection with gross or subtle expressions of worship&#8212;that the end goal is only attainable when the worshipper&#8217;s consciousness identifies with the form under which the deity is conceived. With respect to the Indian context, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy once expressed this idea as follows:</p>
        <p>Only when concentration <italic>dhyanam</italic> is thus realised in full <italic>Samadhi </italic>is worship achieved. ... One should set up in temples the images of angels who are the object of his devotion, by mental vision of their attributes; it is for the full attainment of this yoga vision that the proper lineaments of images are prescribed; therefore the mortal imager should resort to transvision, for thus and no otherwise, and surely not by direct perception, is the end to be attained (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcd1f0dd2-25c7-466e-83e6-ce81ec2af588">Coomaraswamy 1956, 165&#8211;66</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the following sections, the ongoing presence of ethereal, winged half divinities, as an important aspect of architectural and sculptural details in Indian religious architecture, is introduced with the help of selected examples from Ahmadabad&#8217;s early nineteenth and twentieth century history, which emerged as a result of the entanglement between local and imported Western art forms.</p>

        <title>Regional concepts of art and architecture in Ahmadabad</title>
        <p>Ahmadabad has long been a merchant communities&#8217; trading centre in western India. It was important to both the ruling dynasties in this region and Mughal rulers of India with seats of power in Delhi. Hindu merchant communities, along with other multireligious and multicultural communities, represented a large percentage of the city&#8217;s population. Followers of the Jaina religion formed a significant part of the population, along with Vaishnava followers, another large group.</p>
        <p>In regard to their art and architecture, followers of these religions drew their entire associative attributes from the mainstream idiom of Indian Buddhist and Jaina art, architecture, and the meanings they portrayed. Regional traditions were complemented by the inclusion of interpretative forms of various religious faiths and their own expressions of belief. In Ahmadabad, some Hindu communities followed subsidiary religious faiths like Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Sampradaya, which was introduced in the early nineteenth century when Sahajananda established the sect in Ahmadabad. Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Sampradaya (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1d6dcaa1-8269-4a72-ac99-c56307bfd6b4">literally, &#8220;following-faith&#8221;</xref>) became an important religious sect in western India and established its own expression of temple architecture, which also followed mainstream temple architecture traditions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e89"/>
            </p>
        <p>Ahmadabad&#8217;s communities of traders and merchants, especially the Hindu and Jaina, treated the construction of houses as a religious act and always attended to this activity with due reverence. The house was seen as a house of the god in whom the residents believed and was sanctified in the same manner as a temple would have been. The sect also had a tradition of converting their homes into temples: the word <italic>ghar-derasar</italic>, for Jaina, and <italic>haveli</italic>, for Vaishnava, came to mean the same as both communities established temples within their homes and invited the communities to worship in them. This practice also inspired them to consider their houses equally as sacred as temples and to build them with the same dedication, reflecting the same sentiments and religiosity.</p>
        <p>While temples were built in stone and were more expensive due to the sculptural work that went into making them, people found timber a more practical solution when building their houses, as it offered the same plasticity in carving but at a considerably reduced cost. The tradition of woodwork was predominant in house building until the nineteenth century, following which other non-timber materials and newer construction techniques were introduced. In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the limits and plans of house forms remained confined to the traditional neighbourhood framework. However, fa&#231;ade design started changing with people&#8217;s awareness of western popular art. The latter came to be an important feature of the so-called &#8220;modern&#8221; sensibilities of those people who were enamoured with the British presence and its imported practices in all spheres. The travelling merchant classes who had contact with the western world played an important role in advancing and adopting newer cultural imports. The craft communities very quickly grew accustomed to newer materials and techniques of decorative arts and wasted no time in adopting imported arts and crafts. Most of the time, copying architectural forms and decorative details was made easier through photographs and drawings brought from overseas. With these, craftsmen could easily produce almost identical imagery. It is through this process that one can review the progression of artistic transcultural entanglement characterised by rereading, recasting, and translating symbolic attributes. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, tastes leaned toward western models. All building trades were transformed with newer materials and construction techniques. The local craftsmen adopted these methods while older traditions, once such a major part of their lives, were abandoned. The traditions were replaced as craftsmen sought new patrons with transformed tastes and lifestyles.</p>
        <p>Symbolic religious imagery, which was an attribute of art and architecture of temples, was mimicked on houses. Even though they retained the overall sense of symbolism and themes which were traditionally expressed in built forms, craftsmen possessed a certain freedom of expression by using the concurrent materials and craft practices. As the new elements were reworked in the field of building with features from other cultures, especially Western culture, and introduced as &#8220;progressive,&#8221; the traditional themes were reread and remodelled in newer forms and imagery. This development was brought in by European, and especially British, society that established its presence in Ahmadabad on a more permanent basis, and was also possible due to increasing exchanges between merchants, traders, and communities across the seas. This way, the city and its architecture started reflecting imagery that reflected similarities to Western culture, which would establish them as an international society and further their interests in the wider world.</p>
        <p>Heavenly imagery is found in architectural elements in the city&#8217;s temples and houses, where winged figurines are always shown with ethereal dispositions suggestive of their skyward movements and spiritual domains. This symbolic imagery is present in art and architecture from ancient times and has continuously evolved in its form and likeness, depending on prevailing artistic practices, within the cultural continuum. This way, significant cross-cultural exchanges are reflected in Ahmadabad&#8217;s nineteenth-century celestial figures. For the examination and description of the sculpted ethereal imagery that can be attached to each place, <italic>genius loci</italic> in the true sense of the term, three examples of temples situated in Waghan Pol, in the historic city of Ahmadabad, are selected. The Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th Temple, visited by followers of Jainism, was built in 1798 CE and was successively renovated in 1904 CE. The Ajitn&#257;th Temple, built in 1799 CE and renovated in 2007 CE, is also a place of worship for Jainas, whereas Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;s visit the M&#257;hav&#299;r Sv&#257;mi Temple, erected in 1822 CE.</p>

        <title>Ethereal imagery in Jaina temple architecture </title>
        <p>Ahmadabad&#8217;s historic city has hundreds of Jaina temples, sacred places that mark the threshold across which one attains liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID30d11bc2-7b44-433a-9e59-0435c026cb17" rid="TO_LINK">Skt. <italic>t&#299;rtha</italic>
               </xref>). Some can be dated back to the city&#8217;s founding in the early fifteenth century. Jaina temple architecture subscribes to the mainstream Hindu temple architecture tenets and is dedicated to T&#299;rtha&#7749;kara images, as worshipped by the patrons. Jaina temples differ in the matter of their detailing and sculptural thematic schemes as far as their interiors are concerned. However, their overall form and composition are very similar to their sources in regional Hindu temple architecture. Jaina temples, though, are built with concurrent practices and testify to different preferences of stylistic expressions. Since the importance of daily worship plays an important part in Jaina family life, a temple&#8217;s proximity to residential areas is also very significant with respect to its location within the city. For the patron who finances the building of a temple, which can also be referred to as a <italic>jin&#257;laya,</italic> a <italic>derasar,</italic> a <italic>ghar-derasar,</italic> or a miniaturised <italic>t&#299;rtha</italic>, it is important that the endowment raises the level of piety attained (Skt. <italic>punya</italic>). Since historic times, Ahmadabad&#8217;s Jaina temples, spread all over the historic city within community settlements, have been in a constant state of maintenance (Skt. <italic>jirnoddhara</italic>), repair, and worship. The Jaina community, the rich merchants and their families, continuously finance these activities, which are accepted as their sacred duty towards the religion.</p>
        <p>The Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th Temple (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdd628adf-b96c-494b-89f8-229ab7c9e815">Fig. 1</xref>) was built in 1798 CE, but restored in 1904 CE. Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th was the twenty-third T&#299;rthankara of the Jaina T&#299;rthankara. The Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th Temple was not maintained in the past, though it is believed to be 500 years old. The fa&#231;ade is comprised of composite pillars with motifs that translate from Mughal architecture and are suggestive of tapering trunks, with crossed capitals supporting ornate, cusped arches (Skt. <italic>tora&#7751;as</italic>) which span the openings. The Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th Temple was in a very derelict state in the early twentieth century and was therefore remodelled. Special attention was given to the exterior, with its rather recent treatment of form and statuary (<xref rid="IDc102f84f-259a-4ab4-83d9-a500fb2ce673" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe8680f7f-6943-487e-934d-777d7b39dd41">Shah 1996</xref>). The winged, angelic spirits depicted&#8212;<italic>vidy&#257;dhar&#299; </italic>and<italic> gandharv&#299;&#8212;</italic>are all female and made out of reinforced plaster molds, a new technique and an easier statuary method than the traditional stone or wood.</p>
        <p>The statuary on the external fa&#231;ade&#8212;on which some figures are depicted with wings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6c5c02ed-f431-4068-b9af-5b0c5897aa2f">Fig. 2</xref>), and others without&#8212;was completely renovated and is very curious because of its formal treatment of imagery stylised in a medley of both &#8220;Western&#8221; and &#8220;local&#8221; forms. While some female figures are reminiscent of statues of the Virgin Mary, others recall nature spirits (Skt. <italic>yak&#7779;i&#7751;&#299;s</italic>) holding fly whisks, or even K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a playing flutes (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9a5adef7-2e33-4071-8690-9164fd44e25f">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 1 here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 2 here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 3 here]</p>
        <p>The figures&#8217; drapery, attributes, and facial likenesses have no parallel in Jaina sculptural arts of any preceding period. The seraphical female forms in the Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th Temple are completely draped in dresses depicting the contemporary stylistic preference of <italic>saris</italic> wrapped around each leg separately with their ends passing over one shoulder, which differed from the local style. In Gujarat, <italic>saris</italic> are shorter and wrapped around both legs, then tied at the waist with ends brought before the upper body, covering the entire front. The facial features, ornaments, and headgear of the figures also show evidence of an entanglement with external stylistic features. A crown seems to be worn on all the sculptural figures and replaces the cap (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd361e580-a006-4a25-a20d-a0108ae24949">paghri</xref></italic>) which was the traditional headgear in earlier times. Shifts in iconographic preferences affected the sculptural depictions of traditional themes that tried to maintain thematic content similar to what had been expressed through ethereal imagery in earlier periods.</p>
        <p>In contrast to modern achievements, the western part of the Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th Temple exhibits the fragments of earlier sculptures on pillars (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcfc9308d-208f-4986-a613-5cb34d52c4ee">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, classical traditions have been strictly followed in the figurative sculpture of an adjoining M&#257;havir Temple. The temple was erected between 1797 and 1800 CE and remodelled in later periods after major parts of this temple were destroyed in a fire in 1846 CE (<xref rid="IDc102f84f-259a-4ab4-83d9-a500fb2ce673" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9609e80a-329e-4c5b-b798-5f5c9e2dc8bb">Shah 1996</xref>). Here, the entire architectural treatment displays post-Mughal features.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 4 here]</p>
        <p>The similarity and close proximity of the original parts of the two temples, Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th and M&#257;havir, could be attributed to the patrons who financed the construction and temple repairs. Their choices and preferences were followed by the builders of the temples. In fact, the Rajasthani craftsmen working on these temple buildings were the carriers and translators of architectural imagery. The patrons and the master builders had a free hand in detailing different building elements.</p>
        <p>Although Cint&#257;ma&#7751;i Par&#347;van&#257;th Temple is one year older than the Ajitn&#257;th Temple (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6ede62a6-7e2d-40c2-b754-2f4405c6ff97">Fig. 5</xref>), the antiquity of the Ajitn&#257;th Temple has been very strictly maintained (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID452dc9bd-994c-4dee-bd6a-191490622e89">barring the unusual painting of woodwork</xref>). This temple is one of the few surviving examples of wooden temples in the historic city and is dedicated to Ajitnath, the second of the twenty-four Jaina T&#299;rthankara. It is unique in its form as it is scaled and detailed almost like a house, or abode of god, in the dense residential area of the historic city. It is otherwise unique for a city temple as it is located within a court surrounded by a number of sub-shrines on three sides, lending it the importance of a sacred place (Skt. <italic>t&#299;rtha</italic>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 5 here]</p>
        <p>The pillars and beams are richly carved and form a central hall (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDbc087abb-9bda-4208-a954-4715c7d66475" rid="TO_LINK">Skt. <italic>ma&#7751;&#7693;apa</italic>
               </xref>) which is naturally lit by windows and an open storey above. The interior has been profusely decorated, presumably in a later period, with mirrors and glass lampshades known as <italic>handi</italic>, reminiscent of nineteenth century taste. Very unlike a Jaina temple, it is also oil painted in bright colours and lacquered. The interior structure is also richly decorated, for instance with carved pillars with sculptural brackets attached to them. These brackets depict female flying spirits of various types, combining the attributes of <italic>vidy&#257;dhar&#299;</italic> and <italic>gandharv&#299;</italic> in one form (Figs. 6 and 7). Sixteen such figurative brackets with varying features on four central pillars testify to a unique concept of detailing brackets in the traditional Jaina temple architecture, where full brackets symbolise flying spirits in female form.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 6 here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 7 here]</p>
        <p>The brackets in wooden architecture that transfer and distribute the load have always been a very symbolic element in the construction of pillar beam assemblies. Here, the figurative brackets of the timber construction create an aura of mystic meaning and are symbolic of eternity. The flying spirits somehow express an upward-moving gesture (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcdb2dbc3-eb14-4349-8f11-1d9698ffd24d">Figs. 8 and 9</xref>) that evokes the impression that the entire temple is being lifted heavenward, toward the abode of the gods. The symbolic wings on the angels are treated differently, depicting either an upward or downward profile, and provide an imaginary upward surge of spirits, in an effort to transport and imaginatively inspire worshippers.</p>

It was established by Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a as the first seat &#8220;N&#257;r&#257;-N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Dev Gadi&#8221; in Ahmadabad. A British agency gifted about 5000 acres of land in what is known as the Kalupur area of the historic city of Ahmadabad. The second seat was established by Sv&#257;mi Sahaj&#257;nanda at Vadtal, known as Lak&#7779;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Dev Gadi, on 21 November, 1825. Several such temples were later built in the western part of Gujarat and in Saurashtra, where the temple complexes had similar establishments in the form of <italic>haveli,</italic> where the monks stay, and the temple for Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a worship, at the centre of the complexes. In all these cases, a temple for women was constructed separately.</p>
        <p>The Ahmadabad Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Temple is an elaborate establishment built in the typical, locally-prevalent style of a <italic>haveli</italic>, which was very distinct in its richness of exquisite craftsmanship and ornate wooden fa&#231;ades. This idea of richly-carved and decorated wooden fa&#231;ades, and <italic>haveli</italic> architecture, forms an impressive aspect of the Kalupur temple complex. The fa&#231;ades of the north and west sides of the <italic>haveli</italic> complex create an impressive central courtyard&#8212;the main festival area in front of the temple. The imposing gateway on the west forms the main entrance to the complex, which has a temple for women flanking the entire entrance area outside the gate and marks an impressive front approach to the gate. The roofs and the spaces within the large <italic>haveli</italic> somehow recreate a northern Indian aura very different from the local character. The interiors have very distinct monumental spaces reminiscent of northern Indian <italic>haveli</italic> architecture, with massive timber halls supporting roof structures complete with corner towers and large span trusses.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 10 here]</p>
        <p>The public place of the central court has fa&#231;ades similar to those found on <italic>haveli,</italic> which are characterised by a tiered post and beam construction, with floors projecting outwards, and supported on pillars by ornately carved brackets. The carving details on these brackets vary greatly and are prominent parts of the building. The details actually provide the entire architectural expression of the fa&#231;ade with its thematic and symbolic content. It is here that the scheme of the imagery reflects the idea of the building and its associative symbolism for the culture and religion it represents. The theme on these fa&#231;ades is to express the idea of worship of the Sampradaya and its associative gods, which find prominent places in the carved brackets (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID39ab8398-d356-4151-b07d-ea15ca4f37ee">Fig. 11</xref>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 11 here]</p>
        <p>Since the brackets display various aspects of the gods&#8217; realm, and the activities of the gods and their devotees (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID062ad25d-9c93-48c4-b669-56cffafd46dc">l&#299;la</xref></italic>), the presence of ethereal spirits witnessing and celebrating these <italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDafab1794-fd82-4b47-bcd7-e46f1023d081">l&#299;la</xref></italic> form an important aspect of the symbolic imagery of the carved forms. The sculptures (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb3270167-f5da-43b0-aa13-837e7d69fa80">Fig. 12</xref>) are dressed in accordance with the norms as accepted by the tenets of the <italic>Sampradaya, </italic>where the full clothing of human bodies is imperative to righteous conduct in society. The forms of the ethereal images also vary stylistically, and express the craftsmen&#8217;s freedom and delight in producing a gay abundance and a sense of &#8220;wonder&#8221; or emotive stimuli, <italic>vismaya bhava</italic>. The portrayal of these stimuli in characters and their postures creates a mental state in the craftsman (Skt. <italic>rasa</italic>) that depends on the activity and the gender of the depicted character. This results in the re-interpretation of the classical definitions of <italic>vidy&#257;dhara</italic> or <italic>vidy&#257;dhar&#299;</italic>, <italic>gandharva</italic> or <italic>gandharv&#299;</italic>, <italic>kinnara</italic> or <italic>kinnar&#299;</italic> and, Sampradaya norms in particular.</p>

        <title>The sacred and the mundane</title>
        <p>From the nineteenth until the early twentieth century, winged celestial beings populated not only Ahmadabad&#8217;s temples but also numerous residential buildings. Carved figures can still be found decorating beam ends, wooden struts, and capitals.  </p>
        <p>The city&#8217;s houses also started to be built with newer materials, though within the old framework of the settlements (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf00af92a-87ac-49b1-8c29-57ccd9f1ff0a">pol</xref></italic>). Fa&#231;ades began to appear in new forms, with more and more stucco imagery, and Western-style statuary (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID832de696-645b-4773-b718-ce54743f7843">Fig. 13</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e341"/>
            </p>
        <p>[Fig. 13 here]</p>
        <p>Since the entanglement with Western building forms also affected the costumes that were depicted, newer statuary often displayed male and female figures in European garb, with hitherto foreign features, as well as the fair-skinned, scantily clad female body, which came to symbolise a &#8220;fairy.&#8221; All statuary was thus transformed by Western art forms. This shift gave rise to the total subversion of traditional art forms, and a new type of popular art gained currency in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Ahmadabad, transforming both domestic architecture, and art and architecture&#8217;s symbolic attributes. The transformation was so complete that all practices related to building changed, and British building practices were completely integrated into mainstream art and architecture, not only in Ahmadabad, but throughout most of the country.</p>

        <title>Religious beliefs and camouflaged imagery</title>
        <p>Artistic expression, as is evident in Ahmadabad&#8217;s historic temples, was representative of human beliefs and in tune with the classical traditions followed by the patrons, artists, and craftsmen who produced them. With respect to architectural representation (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc58f67e9-ed98-4632-a216-4fe911bd428e">sadrasya</xref></italic>) and proportion, scale, and type (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf68c9ff9-a27d-4727-b4e9-4c546882b05b">pramana</xref></italic>), creators of art who had gained insight into religious canons and texts adhered to fundamental principles: They &#8220;found&#8221; and internalised the form through their imagination. The imagination was inspired by the themes with which they dealt. This act of &#8220;finding&#8221; an expression through one&#8217;s own imagination was like worship (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4c97e464-ef08-4831-90df-e3d9ca9e68b9">bhakti</xref></italic>) dedicated to one&#8217;s inner self. Aspects of Indian art were thus a result of a deep intellectual, mental and artistic endeavour which was undertaken to imagine and create symbolic attributes in representational art to create a sense of wonder. This process was self-initiated, where an artist was occupied by a religious duty towards the creative role assigned to him. These artistic traditions survived in India for a long time, and still do in craft communities that have the same approach to their work today: they apply their skills to the religious edifices which are built with the same devotion and employ the same imagery, adhering to beliefs that captivate the minds of the religious followers. Since religious beliefs have long been the foundation of the community&#8217;s way of life, these traditions were adopted in all expressions of both temple and domestic architecture, and thus the environment reflected the cultural traits of the people. This was also a reason for adopting European art and imagery, which actually became identified with the taste and preferences of the colonial state and local people&#8217;s readiness for subjugation. The translation of the West, evident, for example, in the camouflaged imagery, changed the entire architectural environment of Ahmadabad.</p>
        <p>Popular art emerged as a result of the entanglement between local and imported post-Renaissance European art in late nineteenth and early twentieth century India. This artistic development resulted in hybrid imagery within both the temple and the domestic environments. Now, the flying spirits that were once gloriously inspirational attributes of residential buildings seem to have &#8220;flown away&#8221; from a gradually advancing society and have taken a back seat. Where they remain on temples, they bring artistic and religious traditions to mind.</p>

        <p>	 The vaishnavite Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a faith was established by Ghanshyam Pande, or Sahajananda, later known as Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a (2 April 1781&#8212;1 June 1830), who hailed from Chhapaiya in Uttar Pradesh, Central India. He settled in Gujarat around 1799. In 1800, he was initiated into the Uddhav Sampradaya by his guru Ramananda Svami, and was given the name Sahajananda Svami. In 1802, his guru handed over the leadership of the Uddhav Sampradaya to him before his death. Sahajananda Svami held a gathering and taught Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a mantras. From this point onwards, he was known as Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and regarded as an incarnate God by his followers. Within the faith, Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is equated with the Supreme Being, <italic>purusottama</italic>. The Uddhav Sampradaya became known as the Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Sampradaya, which he spread in western India as he travelled through this region in the early nineteenth century, and found a great following in the vaishnavites<italic>,</italic> the followers of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u (See Barrot 1987, 67&#8211;80).</p>

      <fn id="bibd2e228">
        <p>	 This faith has a large group of believers and has established its own dominion through constructing temples and institutions throughout the world, wherever its followers have settled. When Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a died, he had a following of 1.8 million people. In 2001, Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-centres existed on four continents, and the congregation was recorded to be five million, the majority in homeland Gujarat (see Williams 2001, 68 and see Rinehart 2004). In 2007, the newspaper <italic>Indian Express</italic> estimated members of Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a faith to number over 20 million worldwide (see Rataul 2007).</p>
