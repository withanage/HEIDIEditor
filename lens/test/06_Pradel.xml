      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>In the mid-sixth century, Buddhism and with it its pantheon of deities arrived in Japan.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e45"/> This paper focuses on the flying or heavenly beings represented around Buddhas and bodhisattvas. In spite of being quite conspicuous in early Buddhist temples and on icons, such beings are seldom the subject of study, perhaps because they are not the focus of devotion. Their role seems to be to enhance the radiance of the Buddhist world. The aim of this paper is to trace the origins of these heavenly beings and their arrival in Japan. Through the analysis of visual and textual material, this paper demonstrates that the type of heavenly being that came to Japan was a composite being created in China that combined the Indian prototype of flying beings with the Chinese idea of immortal beings soaring through the skies on clouds.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Flying beings (Jap. <italic>hiten</italic>) or heavenly beings (Jap. <italic>tennin</italic>) accompany Buddhas and bodhisattvas in a variety of Buddhist monuments in Japan. These being are typically painted on the walls of temples, such as the late seventh or early eighth century murals in the Golden Hall of H&#333;ry&#363;ji (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID791666a1-8187-4982-b8ed-5d141bd0f559">Fig. 1</xref>), a temple located in Nara Prefecture.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e104"/>
         </p>
      <p>[Fig. 1 here]</p>
      <p>The beings can also be depicted in wooden reliefs attached to the walls of temples, such as in the twelfth century Phoenix Hall of the By&#333;d&#333;-in, located in Kyoto.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e113"/> Their apparent lightness and ability to soar on clouds in the skies, their scarves billowing, gives the sense that they inhabit a celestial world. These heavenly beings began to appear in Japan around the mid-sixth century, when Chinese culture was introduced through Korean kingdoms. As stated above, the main purpose of this paper is to trace the iconographical and stylistic origins of these beings by finding their prototypes in East Asia (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa2c40d4e-78c0-40c6-aeaa-bd99413e6794">China and Korea</xref>) and India.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e118"/> I will argue that the type of Buddhist heavenly being that arrived in Japan between the sixth and early eighth centuries was a combination of Indian celestials and Chinese immortals.</p>
      <p>This paper begins with a discussion of the representations of flying beings in China during the Han Dynasty (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb3967174-7df5-4682-b080-527edc43ef9d">206 BCE&#8211;220 CE</xref>): the &#8220;feathered men&#8221; (Ch. <italic>yuren</italic>) and the winged deities associated with the immortality cult. Next, I continue with a study of flying deities brought by Buddhism to Japan, addressing selected examples in Buddhist cave temples of the fifth and sixth centuries located in northern China that show the adoption of Indian-type heavenly beings. Around the same time, the evidence shows that a new type of heavenly being&#8212;called the Southern-type&#8212;was created in southern China. This paper ends with a brief discussion of the adaption of these beings for the Korean peninsula and the Japanese islands, as these areas began to embrace Buddhism and Chinese culture.</p>

      <title>Feathered-men and winged immortal beings of the Han Dynasty</title>
      <p>This section presents the feathered men and the winged immortals of the Han Dynasty in China, and also addresses textual material that refers to their ability to soar the skies. A number of small gilt bronze sculptures, known as &#8220;feathered men&#8221; have been found in tombs (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID529dbbb6-e7f5-40e2-b865-4b0242f95c1d">Fig. 2</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e134"/> Most kneel barefooted, and have long bodies with wing-like appendages on their backs. Their facial features emphasize their mythological nature: they have raised eyebrows, sunken eyes, pointed sharp noses, protruding lips, and very large ears extending above their heads. These sculptures appear to have a functional purpose, since some have containers attached to them and others have grooves suggesting that they served as supports.</p>
      <p>The feathered men have been identified as immortal or transcendent beings that existed beyond space and time. They were believed to live amid sacred mountains in a numinous realm removed from the world of humankind (<xref rid="IDa9e91530-7105-4108-93e4-e2798c3ddc8f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID25da7eb2-6840-4472-b3e7-b8703336119f">Little 2000, 149</xref>). Immortal beings are associated with the immortality cult, a series of beliefs and practices which included the search for longevity and immortality. This cult began as early as the Qin dynasty (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1ba34f74-ca1e-42fa-b462-b98a92f03573">221&#8211;210 BCE</xref>) and spread during the Han dynasty. Achieving immortality or &#8220;no death&#8221; (<italic>busi </italic>in Chinese) became one of the main goals of devout Daoists, and immortal beings became an important aspect of the religion (<xref rid="ID91e74dc0-1db3-47f9-a64b-ee87a5a32817" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4f7266d5-e89f-484a-8420-2aa51a137578">Penny 2000, 110</xref>).</p>
      <p>[Fig. 2 here]</p>
      <p>What we call in English an &#8220;immortal, adept or transcendent being&#8221; is the translation of various Chinese terms. An early textual description in the <italic>Zhuangzi </italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID29772289-d937-45a8-ad4b-31798d34fa9e">Master Zhuang&#8217;s Book</xref>) refers to them as &#8220;spirit beings&#8221; (Ch. <italic>shenren</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e154"/> It states:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>In the mountains of far-off Ku-yi there lives a &#8216;spirit being&#8217; whose skin and flesh are like ice and snow, who is gentle as a young girl. He does not eat the five grains but sucks the wind and drinks the dew; <italic>he rides the vapor of clouds </italic>[italics added], yokes flying dragons to his chariot, and roams beyond the four seas. When the spirit man concentrates he keeps creatures free from plagues and makes the grain ripen every year.</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Scholars of Daoism contend that the spirit being mentioned in this text is the immortal (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbc906e8c-6543-4b19-aea8-e0f4b26dc684">xianren</xref></italic>) or transcendent being (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5bbc2143-3101-40dd-aa6f-c3d85f3e54de">shenxian</xref></italic>) of later literature.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e181"/> Wings are not included as part of the description of this spirit being, but the quote indicates that he had the ability to soar the skies by &#8220;riding the vapor of clouds,&#8221; making it clear that clouds were the propelling force that allowed him to be airborne.</p>
      <p>An important deity in the Han dynasty&#8217;s immortality cult was the Queen Mother of the West (Ch. <italic>Xi Wang Mu</italic>), the ruler of Kunlun or the Western Paradise, where immortal beings and fantastic creatures abound and hares prepare the drug of immortality.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e191"/> The Queen Mother of the West, her male counterpart, the King Father of the East (Ch. <italic>Dong Wang Gong</italic>), and their immortal attendants are represented as winged beings on a series of reliefs found in Jiaxiang, Shandong Province. The most famous of these are the stone slabs from the Wu Liang Shrines from the Eastern Han Dynasty (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID23931580-7fb1-43e4-bea9-f9e2a7b55e31">25&#8211;220 CE</xref>), where winged immortals are especially prominent on two opposing triangular gables and roof slabs (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID499d11d9-bfed-4e2f-ba29-0ea01d08fb35">Figs. 3a and 3b</xref>) (<xref rid="ID4a3ef06f-c412-44b5-bccd-fd06b9d08976" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6f7ae9be-c03c-45aa-acd9-95a497ab8ab8">Wu Hung 1989</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e199"/>
         </p>
      <p>[Fig. 3a here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 3b here]</p>
      <p>In most cases, the Queen Mother of the West and the King Father of the East are in the center of the composition, seated and forward-facing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e210"/> Both beings have crescent-shaped wings on their shoulders and are surrounded by a variety of fantastic beings, including winged anthropomorphic figures. Because the slabs are carved in very low relief and in a shadow&#8208;like style of representation, the details of some of the winged beings are not clearly visible. Some, however, have the characteristic big ears above their heads and others have pointed hair styles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e215"/> The figures of immortals are in profile view; some have only one wing on their backs, whereas others have two. An interesting feature of the winged immortals that demonstrates they are airborne is the depiction of bent legs. In some cases, such as on the roof slab of Stone Chamber 1, winged immortals are portrayed with multiple curls replacing their lower limbs and appear to float in the sky. These curls resemble abstract clouds, perhaps portraying the idea that immortals rode on the vapor of clouds.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e220"/>
         </p>
      <p>The representation of the Queen Mother of the West and the King Father of the East as winged figures in the company of winged immortals continued in China through the Three Kingdoms period (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9481b5d2-4af9-479b-b0ed-9c1ae042f219">220&#8211;265 CE</xref>), particularly on bronze mirrors with cosmological diagrams (<xref rid="IDa9e91530-7105-4108-93e4-e2798c3ddc8f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3b1a0190-0e94-4e6c-ad25-2c356f43461d">Little 1988, 12.</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e226"/> Hence, we can safely conclude that winged and feathered figures with the ability to fly were an important component of the immortality cult during the Han period. In their visual representations, their wings or airborne poses create a convincing portrayal of the extraordinary immortal land inhabited by the Queen Mother and the King Father somewhere in the heavens. In addition, textual sources inform us that some rode on clouds. In later Daoism, a new pantheon of deities and new types of immortals replaced the feathered men and winged immortal beings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e231"/>

      <title>Heavenly beings in China </title>
      <p>Buddhism arrived in China around the first century CE, but the more monumental Buddhist projects only date to the early fifth century, when China was politically divided. Known as the Age of Disunion, or the Northern and Southern Dynasties, this period lasted roughly from the late fourth century through the unification by the Sui dynasty in 589. North China was under the control of non&#8208;Chinese groups, who established dynasties such as the Northern Liang (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1c454b77-0526-49e6-b171-f4489d464946">419&#8211;440</xref>), Northern Wei (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb07e0188-2a38-4eb8-999a-378c7a430236">386&#8211;534</xref>) and Eastern Wei (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2270e533-5bc9-43db-b346-7c8576da92ad">534&#8211;550</xref>), among others. The descendants of the Han settled in the south, establishing a number of short&#8208;lived dynasties, such as the Southern Qi (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="ID354ded2e-84da-4760-a93d-83965345e315">479&#8211;502</xref>) and Southern Liang dynasties (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe931de3e-e550-47e9-b637-3416391cc9c4">502&#8211;557</xref>). Both the North and South embraced Buddhism, but the extant evidence is mostly from the northern dynasties.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e241"/> In addition, it is known that some cultural interaction between these two areas took place and that, in spite of the scant physical evidence, the southern dynasties played a major role in artistic developments (<xref rid="IDe6966650-160d-4139-9e80-d37fe727008d" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf34c418a-4405-4a74-9888-4dc63f240c76">Soper 1960</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e246"/>
         </p>
      <p>During this period of time, the interiors of cave temples sponsored by the Northern Dynasties were filled with Buddhas and bodhisattvas surrounded by wingless flying beings, which are clearly based on Indian prototypes. In India, as discussed in the chapters by Ebba Koch and Rabindra Vasavada, as well as in Nepal, as per the contribution by Niels Gutschow and Katharina Weiler, flying beings are attendants to <italic>devas</italic>, or gods inhabiting the heavens. The beings are classified according to their roles and gender: for instance, those flying above the halos of Buddhas are the bearers of wisdom (Skt. <italic>vidy&#257;dhara</italic>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf2b9f6ae-7f6b-4057-895c-97a840de3f42">Fig. 4</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e258"/>
         </p>
      <p>[Fig. 4 here]</p>
      <p>In addition, heavenly maidens (Skt. <italic>apsaras</italic>, Jap. <italic>tennyo</italic>) and male heavenly musicians have also been depicted (Skt. <italic>gandharvas</italic>, Jap. <italic>kandaba</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e278"/>
         </p>
      <p>Before discussing the visual representation of flying beings that arrived in China with Buddhism, a brief introduction of the nomenclature is necessary. In English publications of East Asian Buddhist art, flying beings in the Buddhist context are usually referred as <italic>apsaras</italic>, which according to the Sanskrit definition are female. In the Japanese language, these beings are called <italic>tennin</italic> or heavenly beings (<italic>tianren </italic>in Chinese) and sometimes <italic>hiten </italic>(<italic>feitian </italic>in Chinese, literally meaning &#8220;[beings] flying [in] heaven&#8221;). For the sake of simplicity, the term &#8220;flying being&#8221; will be used as the translation of <italic>hiten</italic>. The Japanese scholar Yoshimura Rei, who has devoted much of his academic career to the study of <italic>tennin</italic> in East Asia, argues that the term <italic>hiten </italic>is mostly used in modern scholarship, seldom appearing in Buddhist texts or historical sources. He explains that the term used in the Chinese translation of Buddhist sutras is <italic>tianren,</italic> or &#8220;heavenly being&#8221;. Moreover, Yoshimura claims that <italic>tianren</italic> is also found in texts associated with the immortality cult and was used to refer to immortal beings. Therefore, he believes that the term &#8220;heavenly being&#8221; was first used in the context of the immortality cult, to refer to the immortal beings that were believed to soar through the skies, and was later adapted for Chinese Buddhism.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e315"/> In this essay, following Yoshimura&#8217;s study, the term heavenly being is used to refer to anthropomorphic flying beings.</p>
      <p>The discussion that follows is largely based on Yoshimura&#8217;s comprehensive research. After almost five decades of studying representations of heavenly beings on Buddhist and funerary monuments in East Asia, Yoshimura classified them into two types: the Western&#8208;type Buddhist heavenly being and the Southern&#8208;type heavenly being. Accordingly, the Western&#8208;type is based on Indian models, its means of propulsion a heavenly scarf. (I prefer to use &#8220;Indian&#8208;type&#8221; as Yoshimura uses &#8220;Western&#8221;, to indicate their transmission route, rather than their origin). The Indian&#8208;type heavenly being can be found in the early cave temple buildings in the city of Dunhuang (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID50d98f63-d2f9-4988-873a-c085f0f3dd6f">Gansu Province</xref>) and the Yungang grottoes (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb117363e-ca1f-4b31-93b9-742e3f1fd6c8">Shanxi Province</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e328"/> The Southern&#8208;type being also wears a long Chinese-style robe with wide sleeves and a lengthy looping scarf and, in addition, rides on clouds. This type of heavenly being was first represented in funerary monuments of the Southern Dynasties from the late fifth century. A slightly transformed version can be found in Buddhist monuments from the late Northern and Eastern Wei dynasties. Below is a detailed discussion of the three different types of heavenly beings.</p>
      <p><bold>Indian</bold>&#8208;<bold>type heavenly beings</bold></p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the Indian&#8208;type heavenly being is represented in the cave temples of Dunhuang and Yungang. The earliest cave murals were painted during the Northern Liang Dynasty, in Dunhuang. In Cave 272, built between 421 and 433, Indian&#8208;type heavenly beings surround the mandorla of the main icon, the top of the walls, and the ceilings, according to areas associated with light&#8212;like the mandorla&#8212;and corresponding to the skies (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5ec09507-7edd-41aa-a8af-f30fc7879928">Fig. 5</xref>). The heavenly beings are all quite dynamic: most are represented with their faces in three-quarter view, their naked torsos in frontal view, and their lower bodies covered by long skirts with their legs extended toward the back. The figures all have long, loose scarves with freely flowing ends, which loop above or behind their haloed heads. Their varied and vibrant poses further accentuate their ability to soar through the skies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e350"/>
         </p>
      <p>[Fig. 5 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 6 here]</p>
      <p>The Yungang site, begun around the 460s, was the first grand project sponsored by the Northern Wei rulers. Yungang is located near the first Northern Wei capital, the modern city of Datong, in Shanxi province.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e361"/> The walls of the cave temples are filled with colorful low&#8211;reliefs. Caves 6 and 7, dated to around 470&#8211;490, both have a stupa&#8211;pillar in the center and numerous Indian&#8208;type heavenly beings framing the Buddha images and filling in empty spaces. They are also part of lintels on the doorway. Some kneel with their hands in prayer, and others play musical instruments while flying. The ceilings are covered with these flying figures (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb1a44f35-4d80-4643-bece-6edb06527f72">Fig. 6</xref>). For instance, the rectangular ceiling of Cave 7 is divided into quadrangles framed by bands with a lotus flower in the intersecting points and pairs of flying heavenly beings on either side. In addition, in the center of each quadrangle, is a lotus flower surrounded by six heavenly beings that appear to be flying in circles around the flower.</p>
      <p>Like their Indian counterparts, these heavenly beings wear jewelry and a <italic>dhoti</italic>. The Buddhist sutras refer to heavenly beings flying in the skies while praising the Buddha, playing musical instruments, scattering lotus flowers and burning celestial incense to create a splendid Buddhist land.</p>
      <p><bold>Southern</bold>&#8208;<bold>type heavenly beings</bold></p>
      <p>The Southern Dynasties also embraced Buddhism, but although the material evidence is scant, recent archaeological discoveries have given a better picture of the extent of patronage. Extant funerary monuments show not only the continuity of Han beliefs and practices, but also the creation of new types of deities, perhaps related to the fact that Daoism was taking shape at the time as a thriving, organized religion in the south.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e379"/> Evidence of the continuity of Han immortality beliefs is found in pictorial decorations bricks in tomb chambers. Three tombs unearthed in Danyang County, in Jiangsu Province, are believed to have housed members of the Xiao family, which ruled as the Southern Qi dynasty (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2ea004ac-75d7-472f-bbdc-9526d30a903a">479&#8211;502</xref>). The tombs were built between 493 and 502 and the iconographical program on the bricks within the three tombs, although now damaged, is noticeably similar.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e384"/>On the walls, large elongated figures of immortals with or without wings prance before a tiger on the west wall and a dragon on the east wall. These beasts are the White Tiger of the West and the Green Dragon of the East, two of the so-called Four Directional Animals, which are associated with the four cardinal directions and the symbols of <italic>yin-yang</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e392"/> The concept of <italic>yin-yang</italic> is a key component of Daoism. In brief, they are lines of force that cross and mingle, playing against each other.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e401"/>
         </p>
      <p>In addition to the large elongated immortals leading the way, heavenly beings, which are identified as such by inscriptions, appear above the beasts. These heavenly beings are among clouds that are represented by parallel, horizontal, comma&#8208;shaped lines&#8212;some with quivering ends&#8212;and floral designs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e410"/> Audrey Spiro points out that some of the beings have delicate facial features and appear to be female, whereas others have more masculine features. They all wear graceful, long-sleeved garments with long scarves which form two or more U&#8208;shaped loops with freely-flowing ends. The figures also have ribbons tied around their heads. Their torsos are upright, their legs bent, and they seem to be floating in the air as they ride on the clouds. In addition, their fluid garments and scarves give a sense of a burst of wind (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf5485e3e-733f-438e-96cb-fe4f0441b1f5">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
      <p>[Fig. 7 here]</p>
      <p>A particularly interesting creature that also wears a feathered garment is perhaps a new version of the Han feathered man. Yoshimura has noted that most of the Southern&#8208;type heavenly beings are associated with clouds, as well as a sprouting bud motif and swirling flowers. He argues that these designs are associated with a process of birth by transformation into a heavenly being, which will not be discussed here.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e419"/>
         </p>
      <p>In addition to the heavenly beings identified by inscription at Danyang, a pictorial tile from a tomb at Dengxian in Henan province, dated to the early sixth century, confirms that the term &#8220;heavenly being&#8221; was indeed used to name these beings. The term is incised in the mold of the pictorial brick in between two heavenly beings, linear clouds, and sprouting bud motifs that surround the two heavenly beings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e431"/> The fluid linear treatment of the figures emphasizes their lightness (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb82631aa-0b98-4623-81ef-ac6d28ef66f5">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>[Fig. 8 here]</p>
      <p>Due to the profusion of the Southern&#8208;type heavenly beings in later Northern Wei and Eastern Wei monuments, particularly in the cave temples at Dunhuang, art historians believed that this type of being originated in the North and then spread to the South. Nevertheless, the discovery of the tombs at Danyang and other monuments from the Southern Dynasties demonstrated that this type of heavenly being originated in south China and later spread to the Northern Wei controlled areas, as well as to the Korean peninsula and Japanese islands.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e440"/> Furthermore, a variety of theories about their origins have been proposed. For instance, Yoshimura contends that these heavenly beings are the product of the spread of Buddhism in the south, and that they are the Chinese version of Indian Buddhist heavenly beings. On the other hand, Audrey Spiro argues that the heavenly beings in the Southern Qi tombs are not related to their Indian counterparts. They are stylistically quite different, reflecting the taste of the Qi elite. Moreover, Spiro argues that the appearance of these beings might be based on indigenous beliefs. In fact, she suggests that this new type of heavenly being shows the transformation of the old immortals into aristocratic looking ones, perhaps influenced by the new descriptions of immortals (<xref rid="ID8d30f638-d03f-4514-a0d5-bb4c53f46fc3" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa67658a0-7845-4869-a4ce-33e4ad4871b7">Spiro 1991, 102</xref>).</p>
      <p>Spiro&#8217;s theory is based on the writings of Ge Hong (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="ID65a8f6e6-97fc-46ff-897c-bf3cfb99d92f">283&#8211;343</xref>), in <italic>Baopuzi </italic>(<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID049755f6-05ce-4707-bdc5-6a1eb206a859">Book of the Master that Embraces Simplicity, ca. 320</xref>), which reveal a new discourse about immortals in the Southern Dynasties period. His description states:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>they walk through the raging fire and are not burned, stepping lightly, they cross gloomy torrents; <italic>they fly in the pure air, with the wind as harness and the clouds as chariots</italic> [italics added]. Raising their eyes, they reach the Purple Pole, lowering them, they settle into Kunlun (<xref rid="IDb29f1c71-5c6a-451d-9808-41043d55d5c3" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0d41c075-8de6-4234-a118-479c9bbf8918">Lai 1998</xref>).</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>As with the earlier description of the immortals, clouds are a key element, due to their association with mobility through the sky. In this case, however, wind seems to be another important propelling agent. With this in mind, I would like to refer to the work of Sakai Atsuko, who has demonstrated that the swirling floral and sprouting bud designs usually associated with Southern&#8208;type heavenly beings are a variation of the Han <italic>yunqi</italic> (Jap. <italic>unki</italic>) or cloud energy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e469"/> In Han art, the <italic>yunqi</italic> design of scrolling patterns was a visual trope of the heavenly vapors of the divine world, as seen for instance in the Wu Liang Shrine carvings discussed above. Accordingly, <italic>yunqi</italic> is the manifestation of the <italic>qi</italic>, the transformative and non&#8208;decaying energy of the universe.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e484"/> Sakai argues that the cloud-shaped <italic>qi</italic> continued in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, but that it was also combined with the newly-introduced palmette and floral designs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e495"/> Sakai considers that these new motifs, rather than representing the birth process of a heavenly being as proposed by Yoshimura, are included in the compositions to give a sense of flow, movement, and energy. I agree with Sakai and believe that the combination of clouds and floral designs suggest motion, which together with the graceful linear style of painting, successfully creates the sense that immortals are able to soar through the skies on clouds guided by wind.</p>
      <p><bold>Winged immortals and Southern</bold>&#8208;<bold>type heavenly beings in northern monuments</bold></p>
      <p>The new types of heavenly beings and winged immortals created in the south and discussed above become quite conspicuous in the late Northern Wei monuments, due to the exchange between the southern and northern courts. The dynastic histories show that, from 481 on, the Southern Qi and the Northern Wei courts began to exchange envoys almost annually. Katherine Tsiang argues that these contacts were clearly one of the reasons for the transmission of Southern Chinese artistic forms to the Northern Wei court, and that the northerners were not just passive recipients. Their choice of artistic forms was based on the intention to refashion the Northern Wei as a Chinese dynasty as great as the Han by adopting Chinese culture in their court. One important contributor to this process was decision to move the capital from modern Datong to Luoyang, in 493. Luoyang had been the capital of many great dynasties, the Zhou (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc0e0aec4-d6ff-4466-b8b7-39d87f95bd54">770&#8211;256 BCE</xref>), the Han (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDec7745c0-a04c-486a-b97f-06087169bab5">25&#8211;220 CE</xref>), and the Jin (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4234bf89-afcf-449e-897d-1bc11b44c9cc">265&#8211;316 CE</xref>). It is likely that, in addition to their contacts with the south, the Northern Wei artists might have also had access to the Han period works in the city and its surrounding areas.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e508"/> An example of the introduction of southern funerary iconography to the Northern Wei is the sarcophagus with reliefs of immortals teasing the White Tiger and the Green Dragon (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe9911f1b-cfab-4c2b-9d95-3f739dd001c2">currently in a private collection</xref>), a subject portrayed in the tombs at Danyang. In this case, an immortal precedes the animals while another one follows them. In addition, the tiger and the dragon have female and male riders, respectively. Important to note is that, in this work, garments with angular hems have replaced the tassel&#8208;like hems of the immortals&#8217; clothing. The diagonal, angular hems give the sense that the garments are being blown by the wind. Thick, comma&#8208;shaped clouds and active, winged thunder monsters complete this dynamic heavenly scene.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e515"/>
         </p>
      <p>[Fig. 9 here]</p>
      <p>Another example of a modified Southern&#8208;type heavenly being can be seen in the Buddhist cave temples of Longmen. The first twenty years after the capital was moved to Luoyang were devoted to the construction of the capital, so Buddhist projects were delayed. The earliest Buddhist project was the Central Binyang Cave in Longmen, sponsored by Emperor Xuanxu (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID902164cc-c2a5-4f5b-a236-f82a51d09255">r. 500&#8211;515</xref>) to commemorate his father, Emperor Gaozu (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfe80bff1-bcb2-478f-8902-96c4e5085311">d. 499</xref>). The Buddha images in this cave show the mature Northern Wei style but, importantly, the domed ceiling is filled with the image of ten heavenly musicians (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID81c6b54e-f04a-4483-a904-55ba33ad6139">Fig. 9</xref>) represented in the Southern style. Each of the figures has bent legs, a long looping scarf, and is surrounded by a trail of fluffy clouds. Yet these beings are bare-chested and wear only a <italic>dhoti</italic> or skirt, rather than the elegant southern robe. Hence, it could be argued that this is a composite being dressed like the Indian Buddhist heavenly being, however, stylistically, it is closer to the Southern type of heavenly being and, importantly, rides on clouds.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e526"/>
         </p>
      <p>In addition to the composite heavenly being described above, murals in cave temples suggest that knowledge of other indigenous Chinese deities, such as the winged immortals, reached as far as Dunhuang in Jiangsu Province. The colorful ceilings of caves 249 and 285, dated to the Eastern Wei dynasty (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1ea27c39-1848-4fd2-9b93-7844fdbf4afb">534&#8211;550 CE</xref>), show such a combination. At first glance, the iconographical program suggests that Chinese and Buddhist immortality beliefs were combined; however, Sait&#333; Rieko argues that this dome shows the visual representation of the Chinese understanding of a Buddhist world (<xref rid="IDcd27fb61-a015-444e-9857-3d077367b971" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0ac8db36-b6c3-41a7-9443-3748f6bc2dc7">Sait&#333; Rieko 1995</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e532"/> Cave 249 has a square floor plan, its ceiling composed of four trapezoids capped by a square, thus creating a dome-like structure. The discussion of Cave 249 will be limited here to the eastern side of the ceiling, which is above the main niche containing the main Buddha icon. The subject on this side is Mount Sumeru, the Buddhist cosmic mountain, and a palace supported by a pair of dragons. The four&#8208;armed Vedic god Asura stands in front of the previously described setting. His upper arms are extended to hold the sun and the moon while his lower arms are in front of his chest. The Chinese wind god is depicted to the right of Asura. Below him, a winged monster figure and a Southern&#8208;type heavenly being are depicted among clouds. To the left of Asura are the Chinese thunder god, another winged monster figure, and a bird with a human head (Skt. <italic>kalavinka</italic>). In addition, there are two winged immortals, identifiable by their rabbit-like ears and wings. The other three sides of the ceiling depict similar combinations of Buddhist and indigenous Chinese deities. Sait&#333; Rieko argues that the amalgamation of deities from two different belief systems shows the new Chinese conception of the Buddhist world. Because the deities of the immortality cult appear in this Buddhist context, they should, according to Sait&#333;, be viewed as a part of the Chinese Buddhist world. Sait&#333; thus stresses the importance of context in establishing the meaning of a design. But, as stated above, the term &#8220;heavenly being&#8221; makes for a versatile inhabitant of any heaven and, as such, on the Korean peninsula, where it is found in both funerary and Buddhist contexts.</p>

      <title>Concluding remarks about Chinese winged immortals and heavenly beings</title>
      <p>The visual material discussed above suggests that, in the Han dynasty, flying beings were related to a belief in a land of immortals located in the heavens. For this reason, their inhabitants&#8212;the immortal or transcendent beings&#8212;had the ability to fly to those realms with their wings while others used clouds as vehicles. By the late fourth century, the Indian&#8208;style heavenly being was introduced in Chinese Buddhist monuments and artifacts associated with the Northern Dynasties. As represented in great numbers, mostly on the ceilings of cave temples and surrounding mandorlas, the force for remaining airborne seems to be the long, billowing scarf. Contemporary to the Han dynasty, a new type of flying being&#8212;identified by inscriptions as &#8220;heavenly being&#8221;&#8212;began to be introduced to the funerary iconography and monuments of the Southern Dynasties. As per the Indian&#8208;type, this Southern&#8208;type heavenly being wore a looping scarf suggesting the power of the wind, as well as a long robe with wide sleeves and, probably based on earlier textual sources, rode on clouds.</p>
      <p>Importantly, monuments dated to the sixth century show the creation of a composite heavenly being that, like the Indian&#8208;type, was bare-chested and wore a long skirt and scarf, but was carried by clouds. The inclusion of clouds might have been associated with the concept of <italic>yunqi,</italic> or cloud energy, a driving force. This composite heavenly being was subject to stylistic change, particularly in the Tang Dynasty (<xref rid="ID8a797dd4-e039-4899-a0fb-9d7d2668a181" ref-type="bibr" id="ID63334891-6665-4b22-b5d1-ffdfbc5ef5f7">618&#8211;906</xref>). During this time, the creatures were characterized by the naturalistic representation of the body, with more aerodynamic and contorted poses. Importantly, the cloud design of parallel, curved lines was replaced by a more elongated cloud that integrated the peony-derived motif, which became one of the Tang period&#8217;s predominant designs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e551"/>

      <title>Heavenly beings in Korea and Japan</title>
      <p>Although there are no monumental cave temples on the Korean peninsula or the Japanese islands, the few extant artifacts and mural paintings show that, from the fifth through the eighth centuries, the various flying beings originally created in China began to appear in these areas. In particular, the evidence shows the adoption of the composite heavenly being with its characteristic Chinese cloud. Because the surviving examples are iconographically and stylistically very similar to those of China, this discussion will not include a detailed analysis of those features, but will be limited to mentioning important works, both funerary and Buddhist.</p>
      <p>In Korea, immortals and composite heavenly beings are depicted in the mural paintings found in the complex of funerary mounds of the Kingdom of Koguryo (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID102b0087-ae69-4e0e-adab-2d77f7b6a9c1">37 BC&#8211;668 CE</xref>), particularly on the ceilings representing the heavenly realm.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e563"/> Immortals are found in the fifth century tombs of Tokhung&#8208;ri (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc53a9c2b-be7f-45c2-9507-29703e413856">Nanp&#8217;o city</xref>), the Tomb of the Dancers (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb9fccb22-94a1-4b39-b6d8-243c7e3e6766">Jilin Province, China</xref>), and in the seventh century Great Tomb at Kangso (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID55d73e15-4525-4795-aa27-b1e22830a2cc">Nanp&#8217;o city</xref>). The composite heavenly beings can be found in the fifth century tombs of Chanchuan No. 1 (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID33c38841-3c5e-4a41-ba61-261d68ab2d8e">Jilin Province, China</xref>) and Anak No. 2 (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID44ace20b-4b6b-46d8-84c7-f7277d7a8be3">South Hwanghae Province</xref>). In the case of the Great Tomb at Kangso, the beliefs seem to be those associated with the Chinese immortality cult: the four cardinal animals are portrayed on their corresponding walls, while the lantern roof is filled with fantastic animals, heavenly beings, and immortals. On the first level, on the north side of the ceiling, are four composite heavenly beings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID960e13fb-a1a3-4e0d-ad39-7177747eda03">Fig. 10a</xref>).

      <p>Besides in tombs, heavenly beings are also portrayed on Buddhist artifacts, such as on the bodies of bronze bells. The oldest extant bell, dated to 725 and located at the Sangw&#335;n&#8208;sa Temple on Mount Odae, depicts heavenly musicians. The most well-known of these bells is the Emille Bell, located in the Gyeongju National Museum, Korea (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0996bb7f-8124-4ee1-b248-7c4f943413b4">Fig. 11a</xref>).

      <p>H&#333;ry&#363;ji&#8212;the oldest extant Buddhist temple in Japan&#8212;is the repository of a number of treasures dated to the seventh and early eighth centuries. Located in Ikaruga, in Nara Prefecture, the temple houses, in addition to the heavenly beings on the walls of the Golden Hall (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbf11860c-418e-4c79-a07d-eaf35abb3279">Fig. 1</xref>), objects that give an idea of the variety of media and formats used for the portrayal of heavenly beings. Among the objects, the Tamamushi shrine, a small Buddhist shrine dated to the seventh century and the oldest extant example of painting in Japan, includes a number of anthropomorphic heavenly beings on its painted panels (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID67dba2db-8fa7-4ec1-844d-7e74217de4a0">Fig. 1</xref>2a). The most conspicuous of these are on the front lower panel, which shows two monks worshiping reliquaries; above them, two symmetrically arranged heavenly beings hold a lotus-shaped reliquary (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID72bb81df-bf62-45b1-a7c8-8b1d9b0cc286">Fig. 12b</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e592"/> In this case, as with their continental counterparts, the heavenly beings are portrayed as inhabitants of the Buddhist world.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, sketches of heavenly beings were found during the preservation of some of the treasures at H&#333;ry&#363;ji. For instance, a Southern&#8208;type heavenly being was found on the back side of a wooden panel from the pedestal of the Yakushi Buddha, in the Golden Hall. This discovery is important because, as mentioned above, while most of the heavenly beings in Japan and Korea are the composite type, this sketch demonstrates the arrival of the Southern&#8208;type.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e604"/>

The H&#333;ry&#363;ji collection includes a bronze banner made with openwork plaque.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e620"/> The entire banner consists of a square canopy housing a main banner comprised of six elongated rectangular plaques, arranged vertically. In addition, four shorter inner banners consisting of three plaques each hang from the canopy, which is surrounded by a string of decorative oval pendants. Two of the main banner&#8217;s six plaques have representations of a seated Buddha flanked by attendant bodhisattvas and figures worshipping in shrines. Heavenly beings are portrayed in the rest of the plaques: some bring offerings and others play instruments. Like in the cave temples in China, or the Golden Hall of H&#333;ry&#363;ji, Buddhas and bodhisattvas are praised by the heavenly beings bringing offerings and creating the celestial sounds and splendors of the Buddhist world.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Artists in India and East Asia found convincing ways to represent airborne anthropomorphic beings. In India, a solution to this challenge was to portray the figures with upright torsos and bent legs, or with bodies extended as if they were floating. To further emphasize the illusion that the figures were flying, a long scarf (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcbf0f05c-ab24-459a-b8a9-2fed189e82ee">part of the Indian attire</xref>) billowed, as if catching the wind. This Indian&#8208;type heavenly being reached China when Buddhism was adopted by the Northern Wei and was abundantly portrayed in the cave temples sponsored by this dynasty. Before the arrival of Buddhism, however, the Han Chinese already had their own concept of flying anthropomorphic beings. Accordingly, winged and other types of immortal beings that rode on clouds to reach the heavenly lands were depicted on various funerary monuments and artifacts, because winged and flying immortal beings are associated with the afterlife beliefs of the Han period. The pictorial representations in tombs, and particularly those of the Southern Dynasties, show that the Indian idea of billowing scarves was combined with the Chinese idea of clouds as vehicles to traverse the sky. The Japanese scholar Yoshimura Rei called this newly-created form the Southern&#8208;type of heavenly being, which is represented wearing a Chinese robe, a long scarf, and riding on a cloud. This creature was later adapted for the Northern and Eastern Wei Buddhist monuments, where a composite Buddhist heavenly being wearing an Indian <italic>dhoti</italic>, a scarf, and riding on a cloud became popular. This composite type reached the Korean peninsula and the Japanese islands, where its surviving examples show an adaption of Chinese iconography and styles. As discussed in Niels Gutschow&#8217;s and Katharina Weiler&#8217;s papers, the use of the &#8220;Chinese cloud&#8221; as a propelling element seems to have been adapted for modern depictions of Nepalese flying beings.</p>
