      <title>The Goddess of Victory in Greek and Roman Art</title>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>In Greek and Roman art, a number of winged characters attest a transcultural genesis. The most important and influential of these the goddess of victory, was called Nike in the Greek and Victoria in the Roman world. Both goddesses were usually depicted in a very similar way, but in fact there are clear conceptional differences between them. Against the background of such shifts in meaning, a special phenomenon will be discussed, namely the unusal amount of depictions of Victoria in Roman Syria. Because of the significant role the Levantine region played in contact between the East and Westin ancient times, the question of which beliefs and concepts these figures represented is of special interest with respect to a cross-cultural perspective.</p>

      <title>The Greek goddess: Nike</title>
      <p>In order to better understand the nature and concept of the greek goddess Nike, a closer look at the sources is useful. In the earliest Greek literary testimonials, the epics of Homer, Nike is not mentioned at all. The first known literal evidence is given instead in Hesiod&#8217;s <italic>Theogonia</italic>, written in the sixth century BCE. There, Nike is described as the daughter of the river goddess Styx and the Titan Pallas (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd8007fe3-ee7c-4bf4-842c-1026b825bcb5">Schrinding 2007, 34&#8211;35</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e61"/> Her only known involvement in a myth is her attendance at the fight of the Olympian gods against the Titans, in which she was supporting the party of Zeus and the Olympians (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa67026a2-fbdf-4f87-90f9-dc6f318e8c43">Schrinding 2007, 34&#8211;35</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e79"/> Given the great importance of myths in Greek culture, the lack of any other mythological involvement of Nike indicates that she was a relatively new goddess and was, in fact, more a personification of an abstract concept than a real goddess (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3594eab2-6746-4115-ad83-c67532883856">Shapiro 1993, 27-29</xref>). This argument is further corroborated by the fact that there is a lack of any reference to a cult for her, at least in Archaic and Classical times (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1fdea3b9-ac30-4c7c-b69e-227860f6b3b1">before the third century BCE</xref>). Even in the later Hellenistic period, references to a cult of Nike are very few in number and, in addition, problematic in detail (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2539d74f-2542-43b2-aebf-6ceff5156a93">Th&#246;ne 1999, 57&#8211;76</xref>).</p>
      <p>The basic character of Nike was that of a messenger, sent by a god or goddess into the world of the human beings. Within this role, she specialized in solely conveying one type of message, namely forthcoming victories. Indeed, she is never the one who decides who will win, but her appearance on the side of one of the opponents is a clear sign of who will be the wining party. However, her function is not restricted to the military context. Nike can also be found in agonistic contexts, both artistic and athletic (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6b5035d3-10d5-4dc5-9806-3701a02a4335">Th&#246;ne 1999, 77&#8211;96</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the Archaic period (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID07f869db-2b17-447c-bc18-4db640b39472">700&#8211;480 BCE</xref>) her iconography was not defined in detail, so it is difficult to distinguish her from Eris, who is also known as a messenger of the gods.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e103"/> Because of their similar function, namely to move between the sphere of the gods and the world of human beings, Nike and Eris were both imagined with wings. In order to emphasize their role as messengers, both were depicted with a special baton, the so-called Kerykeion, which was also the specific attribute or symbol of human messengers in ancient times.</p>
      <p>Most Archaic images of Nike can be found in two-dimensional pictures, such as on painted vases. The first known three-dimensional depiction of Nike is the famous Nike of Achermos, erected as a dedication to Apollo on the island of Delos, just before the middle of the sixth century BCE (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5294d092-0bf7-4150-b43e-8225199a2381">Fig. 1a</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e112"/> The sculptor Achermos, who is mentioned in an inscription which is likely to belong to the statue, is known from other sources as being the first artist to make a three-dimensional figure of Nike with wings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e118"/> The sculpture shows the goddess running and flying simultaneously, a motif which was very common when depicting fast, forward-moving figures in Archaic times (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID40c153c3-91b6-42ba-83f9-bdd8be932926">Fig. 1b</xref>). Today, in the German language, it is commonly called <italic>Knielaufschema,</italic> because of the kneeling-like position such characters assume (<xref rid="IDe14a2734-1f9d-49c5-930b-059bbef41c88" ref-type="bibr" id="ID16ce5706-ea37-4d81-b39f-feda69b03819">Schmidt 1909, 251&#8211;397</xref>). This position was also used for other winged characters in this period, such as the Gorgon Medusa.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 1a here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 1b here]</p>
      <p>Nike was frequently depicted in classical times (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID45af8298-11f0-476e-a06d-787ba0444a6f">480&#8211;330 BCE</xref>). Numerous statues of her were erected (<xref rid="ID6cd496f2-aa97-45d9-a052-a2303f5bc147" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5e1a1935-4c83-42a4-afda-babab31b7019">Th&#246;ne 1999</xref>), primarily in the great sanctuaries, where Greek cities dedicated a large number of monuments to military victories, both against foreign invaders as well as against neighbouring, hostile Greek cities. A famous example of such a monument is the Nike of Paionios (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5bd4b7a6-45a8-4c83-aeeb-8a1ce3f4f87d">Fig. 2</xref>), which was erected in Olympia after a victory of the Messenians and Naupaktians against Sparta, in 425 BCE (H&#246;lscher 1974, 70&#8211;111 and Gulaki-Voutira 1981, 41&#8211;49 and Goulaki-Voutira 1992, 862&#8211;863, No. 137 and Th&#246;ne 1992, 117&#8211;118). For this occasion, an 8.5 metre-high pillar crowned by one of the most impressives statues of Nike ever made, was erected just in front of the famous temple of Zeus. The statue evokes the impression of a flying figure, not only because of Nike&#8217;s elevated position, but also due to the special treatment of the very thin garment she wears, which appears to be floating in the wind, and the depiction of an eagle beneath her feet.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 2 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 3 here]</p>
      <p>From the fifth century onwards, the iconography of Nike was more or less standardized. However, some new visual contexts were created, such as scenes depicting the goddess making offerings at an altar (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2f9eba8d-e40a-464d-8115-6bae31e9d368">Th&#246;ne 1999, 36-56</xref>) or, more commonly, erecting or decorating a Tropaion, a very typical monument for a victory, which was usually erected directly after a battle, on the battlefield itself (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbb6dffc4-0b61-4b88-b9aa-f9661f705cda">Th&#246;ne 1999, 114&#8211;119 and Rabe 2008</xref>). This motif, with its clear military background, was even used for monuments glorifying an agonistic victory, as early as the second half of the fifth century BCE.</p>
      <p>In the Hellenistic period (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa0f160a3-6e88-468d-aeee-34beaefea1ef">330-31 BCE</xref>), Nike was very frequently depicted in the official art of Alexander the Great and his political successors (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID31ef73ed-8c3a-42fd-a4c8-cf63eca56f3a">Grote 1992, 881&#8211;895 and 902&#8211;904</xref>). Especially in the beginning&#8212;the late fourth and early third century BCE&#8212;these men ruled primarily on the basis of their military success and, in the tradition of Alexander himself, on the apperance of individual valour and strength. To represent these qualities, the goddess of victory was frequently depicted in close proximity to the king, as she often was on coins from that period. The frequent connection between a ruler and the goddess of victory made her, at least in visual language, more and more a long-term companion of the ruler. Consequently, the ruler himself became able to guarantee the presence of the goddess and, therefore, victory.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e174"/>
         </p>
      <p>In addition, just as in the Classical period, large monuments commemorating military victories were erected by rulers as well as cities, as in the case of the famous Nike of Samothrace (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7eb6b3be-bb7b-40d7-a598-f79062e66aa7">Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID826ba876-fe8e-4f0d-9bce-c0cdfd648a84">Knell 1995 and Hamiaux 2007</xref>). This monument, erected just above the ancient theatre in the sanctuary of the Great Gods on the island of Samothrace, showed the goddess standing on the bow of a ship. The sculpture and ship were made of stone and placed in a basin containing water and rocks, thus simulating a natural setting. This impressive monument was presented by the Rhodians in the early second century BCE, probably after a victory against the Seleucid Empire.</p>
      <p>In summary, by the Hellenistic period at the latest, the image of the winged goddess Nike was widespread and well-known throughout the Mediterranean world, and understood as a concise symbol of different kinds of victory.</p>

      <title>The Roman goddess: Victoria</title>
      <p>The Roman counterpart to Nike was called Victoria.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e195"/> The goddess and her iconography have their roots in Etruscan culture and its iconography, which was heavily adapted from Greek imagery (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID80c58437-bf54-43bd-88e9-9a3b717f4617">K&#228;nel 2009, 74-83</xref>). Therefore it is not surprising that the Roman goddess Victoria was depicted principally in the same way as the Greek Nike. With regard to her function and status, however, clear differences can be observed.</p>
      <p>The most significant of these differences is the fact that Victoria was venerated, as proven by the existence of temples erected to her. The first temple was probably dedicated in the beginning of the third century BCE, by the consul L. Postumius Megellus, on the Palatine Hill.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e208"/> Next to this stop, Porcius Cato built a second temple one hundred years later, dedicated to Victoria Virgo.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e214"/> In Rome and other Italian cities, and later throughout the whole Roman Empire, temples to Victoria can often be attested by their inscriptions. Moroever, the existence of priests for Victoria is well documented (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID49f376ce-70c6-4e92-8fc5-76adb191299e">Vollkommer 1977, 237&#8211;238 and Y&#233;benes 2007, 221&#8211;235</xref>). An important annual festival for Victoria was held on the first day of August. The existence of temples, priests, and a festival day clearly indicate a flourishing cult for Victoria in Roman times.</p>
      <p>However, even in Roman thinking, as clearly stated by Cicero, Victoria is only the messenger whose appearance indicates an upcoming victory, and not the one to determine the victor. Furthermore, Victoria is not the personification of the human power which enables someone to be victorious, Cicero continues. In fact, the goddess Victoria symbolizes an accomplished victory, the final result, but not the means of achieving it. This approach is clearly shown, for instance, in images of the Roman triumph, where Victoria is often depicted standing behind the imperator, holding a golden crown over his head (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID82648689-eb0b-4f7d-8ed7-61080d4a1f51">H&#246;lscher 1967, 80&#8211;90</xref>).</p>
      <p>The act of crowning a victor was also the underlying concept of images showing the goddess alone, in a flying position and holding a crown in her outstretched right or left hand (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4b0dd163-9e85-41d1-9e38-3752fa181811">Figs. 4a and 4b</xref>). This motif became very popular on spandrels, especially on triumphal arches, where the act of crowning was related to the imperator himself and his victorious army. Such imagery was also used to decorate the frames of special passages and doorways where the coronation, the act of being crowned by Victoria, related to the person who used that specific passage in a ceremonial context or, in some cases, even to a god or goddess who was thought to do so. Figures of a crowning Victoria can also be found on niches for statues or on sepulchral monuments.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 4a here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 4b here]</p>
      <p>Because of the great importance of military strength and success for the legitimation of the Roman emperors, images of Victoria were often found in the imagery of the Roman Empire. The prominent role of the goddess in the visual language is underlined by the fact that, even after the rise of Christianity, the goddess continued to be depicted (<xref rid="ID61974eb7-9a7d-4802-8686-d14086ad9f63" ref-type="bibr" id="ID662e2385-bbb6-450f-b005-6e9736895810">Vollkommer 1977, 269</xref>). The Christianised emperors after Constantine (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3cdb5753-7d64-47ff-88a6-6684618ecd97">r. 306&#8211;337 CE</xref>) and Theodosius I (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd5724392-70ce-40bf-8b87-2d271cd445e0">r. 379&#8211;394 CE</xref>) used Victoria widely in their official imagery, just as in the tradition of earlier motifs. A Christianised version of a motif originally invented in Greek times, but primarily and frequently used since early Roman times, was very popular. In the Greek version, the goddess is shown in the process of writing successful military campaigns on a shield. In the later Christianised version, Victoria is writing a Chi-Rho, a Christogram formed by superimposing the capital letters <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter)" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple">Chi</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_(letter)" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple">Rho</ext-link> (&#935;&#929;), of the Greek word <italic>&#935;&#929;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#927;&#931;</italic> (&#8220;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple">Christ</ext-link>&#8221;), on the shield (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6dd15cb7-15e7-4c3e-96c5-95b8b13f5f31">Figs. 5a, 5b</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbb284897-4632-46de-bd19-9de4c84e1baf">H&#246;lscher 1967, 98&#8211;102</xref>). This seems to be a reference to the well-known episode in which  Constantine, on the night before the battle at the Milvian bridge, is said to have had a vision of the Christian Cross in combination with the words "In this sign, you will conquer&#8221; (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3ad2d483-bbe3-4466-8bbd-7f3ac1c85ed5">Dam 2011, 1&#8211;18</xref>).</p>
      <p>[Figs. 5a and 5b here]</p>
      <p>Thus, Victoria remained popular in the official art of the Christian emperors, as well as in sepulchral art. Nevertheless, the goddess was only rarely adapted for ecclesiastical art. Here, the known motifs of triumph were transformed and, in place of Victoria, angels appeared, for example in depictions of Christus Pantokrator, or the triumph of Christ (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb629a504-94e1-4816-803f-f7b8a898c860">Schneider 1989, 29&#8211;64 and Charalampidis 1994, 17&#8211;54</xref>). Indeed, Victoria and the angels were divine messengers of triumph, but it seems that some kind of separation existed. Victoria continued to indicate military success of the Emperor in the profane world, while angels were created to serve the heavenly sphere.</p>

        <title>Cross-cultural developments in the Levant</title>
        <p>In ancient times, the Levantine region already played a very important role in maintaining contact between Asia and Europe. Apart from its local tradition, the material culture of this area showed, even before the conquest by the troops of Alexander the Great in the years just before 330 BCE, strong traits of Greek, Persian, and Egyptian art (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf68d00e8-41a5-44c9-b5ee-3e9d41e64e77">Sartre 2008, 25&#8211;49</xref>). After the death of Alexander, Syria was an important part of the Seleucid Empire, even though the southern part was temporarily conquered by the Ptolemys, the rulers of Egypt. In the second and the beginning of the first century BCE, the Seleucid power declined and different kings and empires tried to gain control over this area. The Armenians first conquered the northern part, while the Nabataeans later took over the south. Around 69 BCE, the Romans under Sulla drove away the Armenians, but the southern part still remained Nabataean. After the interlude of the Herodian rule, the majority of this area was incorporated into the Roman Empire, with only small areas in the south and east remaining under the control of the Nabataen Empire, which was well-disposed towards Rome. However, in the early second century CE, this region was ultimately conquered by Trajan.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e319"/>
            </p>
        <p>Against this historical background, it is not suprising that, at least since Hellenistic times, the Greek pantheon and Greek iconography were widespread and well-known. In the following centuries, different forms and levels of adaption and assimilatation took place in the Mediterranean, especially regarding the use of the names and iconography of the Greek gods and the adoption of Greek models (<xref rid="ID2bdeb210-5260-4e91-b584-2104dd7418be" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7af00f05-9b83-4b49-86e7-ecac38edb3d1">Teixidor 1989, 81&#8211;95</xref>). For instance, the local goddess Allat was identified with different Greek goddesses such as Artemis, Athena, and the muse Urania. Nevertheless, her depictions either recall the iconography of Atargatis or, more frequently, of Athena (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa6366029-a6f4-4268-b5f2-6d4e1c0395b1">Krone 1992 and Friedland 2008, 315&#8211;350</xref>). It seems that the frequent adaptation of Greek and Roman iconography was supported by the fact that many gods in this region were originally worshipped as idols or holy stones, so many of them lacked a strong iconographic tradition (<xref rid="ID5ba9f025-0d77-4961-936f-737d50678e9b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID98e24eaa-a893-4957-9728-734da538f5da">Stewart 2008, 297&#8211;314</xref>).</p>

        <title>Nike/Victoria in the local imagery</title>
        <p>Based on the previously mentioned observations, it is, in principle, not very surprising to find images of Victoria/Nike, which more or less adopt the known Greek and Roman iconography in this region. However, the number of statues and depictions of Victoria/Nike found in the Levantine region in general is surprisingly high. The findspots include the Hauran area, the cities of the Decapolis and Palmyra, and even Petra. With respect to the examination of cross-cultural entanglements, it is reasonable to focus on a special and very representative group of these depictions, namely the three-dimensional statues of Nike/Victoria found in the Hauran area. All figures in this large and homogeneous group can be dated to the first three centuries CE. In addition, nearly all of them were made of basalt, a local volcanic rock, proving they were locally produced rather than imported (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc7f20278-3861-43f0-b2a7-700cbc158e3b">Bellefonds 1997, 879&#8211;882 and Dentzer and Weber 2009, 60&#8211;64</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e351"/> Since very few Hellenistic era depictions of Nike were found in this area, a local tradition may not be the only explanantion for this trend.</p>
        <p>Most of these statues were found as fragments without a clear context. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that many of them were erected in sanctuaries, either as votive figures consisting of a single statue, or as parts of larger monuments. An example of a larger monument was found in the sanctuary of Sahr al Ledja (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID03b07633-ca91-40cc-9ac4-0cb036b41e19">Fig. 6</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID10b46d37-978c-4afc-8b7f-eac05a3bc21a">Dentzer and Weber 2009, 22&#8211;88</xref>). Six smaller and one larger horsemen stood on one side of the top of a large square base, flanked by two pillars with statues of the goddess of victory on the top. On the other side, figures of two chariots had been placed, presumably driven by gods and also flanked by pillars with figures of Victoria. The larger horseman can probably be identified as a local ruler (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDecd1df6a-a020-4544-b7ab-ca4d2d150765">Dentzer and Weber 2009, 71&#8211;88</xref>). Thus, even though the position of the statues of Victoria is remarkable, the function of the goddess as companion of the ruler, as well as of the other gods, is understandable and familiar from Greek and Roman art.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 6 here]</p>
        <p>More surprising is the significant number of individual statues of Victoria, erected in various sanctuaries of local significance. Only a few of them still bear inscriptions, but those preserved neither refer to specific military or private success, nor to Nike or Victoria herself. Most of these statues only mention the name of the dedicator; others praise the gods venerated in the respective sanctuaries. However, there are no clear hints of syncretism between Victoria and a local goddess. Indeed, a few sanctuaries were ascribed to the goddess of victory by modern scholars but, in fact, the only supporting evidence for these assignments consists of the depictions and statues of Victoria found in the context of these temples. Finally, there is no indication that all of these statues were erected as victory monuments reminiscent of Greek sanctuaries. In addition, literal and epigraphic sources do not mention the surprisingly high appeal of Victoria as a subject.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, in order to understand these figures better, the focus must be on the iconography. The statues can be classified into two main iconographic schemes (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID23a1f83a-ecef-484d-8b91-d08c2635ad8b">Dentzer and Weber 2009, 60&#8211;64</xref>). One scheme depicts the goddess with a Greek-inspired garment, a Peplos, belted beneath her breast (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID606e634d-b323-47a0-b08a-9b0a54c2c7db">Fig. 7a</xref>). The knot in her belt, a so-called Heracles knot, which is not very common in Greek and Roman images of the goddess,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e381"/> is remarkable. The second scheme (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc4132fa7-014a-4c36-84c8-6ad3ce133d79">Fig. 7b</xref>) is called the Amazon type, due to the goddess&#8217;s exposed right breast, which is well-known from depictions of Amazons. Furthermore, it is a typical element in the iconography of the goddess Roma, the personification of Rome, and of Virtus, the Roman personification of military strength.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e387"/> In contrast to an uncovered left breast, which represents fast movement and disarrayed clothing, seen for example in the Nike of Paionios in Olympia (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb2e3beae-f2dd-4d29-ab5e-9fc0facaa8d0">Fig. 2</xref>), an uncovered right breast refers, in the case of a female figure, to a readiness to act and fight.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 7a here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 7b here]</p>
        <p>Most of the Syrian statues show Victoria standing on a half or full sphere or globe. This motif of Victoria on top of a globe was very popular in Roman art, since the first emperor Augustus (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdbd7653f-5f9a-45ba-9d80-9d724f9a97fe">r. 27 BC&#8211;14 CE</xref>) had brought a statue of this type from Tarentum to Rome and placed it in the Curia, the house of the Roman senate (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc26553a1-ca8e-4451-aa06-6825c8f2ef44">H&#246;lscher 1967, 6&#8211;47</xref>). The statue from Tarentum might have originally been made for the Hellenistic king Pyrrhus. However, it is unlikely that its globe was added until Augustus transferred the sculpture to Rome, because in Hellenistic art a globe under the feet of Nike is nearly unprecedented (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8c23cd73-2b8e-48dd-ad9c-6f2f9210234f">H&#246;lscher 1967, 12&#8211;17</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e418"/> Therefore, as with the specific dress with an uncovered right breast, even the globes or spheres of the aforementioned Syrian statues must have been inspired by Roman models, and cannot be explained by Hellenistic influence. Hence, even the outstanding popularity of Victoria in Roman Syria must be seen in the context of the expansion of Roman rule or at least Roman art. </p>

        <title>Image adaptation in the context of local religious concepts: Victoria&#8212;Tyche&#8212;Gad</title>
        <p>Against this background, attention should be given to an iconographic detail, the addition of which seems to be a local invention. Some figures are equipped with a cornucopia (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID790bb624-59db-4ac6-b653-f2b891359f70">Figs. 8a and 8b</xref>) as their attribute which, in Greek and Roman art, is only rarely arrtibuted to Nike or Victoria (<xref rid="ID34f285c8-1919-47d6-8106-2c4a4596e602" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4620a75d-7098-4417-8f07-1f6c788c6646">Dentzer and Weber 2009, 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 8a here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 8b here]</p>
        <p>This attribute is usually connected with the goddesses of fortune, Tyche or Fortuna. Moreover, the cornucopia appears in images glorifying Roman power, namely as a symbol of wealth resulting from Roman rule. For visualizing this concept, figures of Tyche/Fortuna, as well as of individual cornucopias, were wide-spread in the Roman visual language. Hence, the addition of this element to some figures of Victoria in Syria could be explained as a concise representation of the aforementioned idea, namely that overall wealth was attributable to the security assured by the dominance and everlasting victory of Rome. Thus, Victoria could have been perceived as the goddess who guarantees Roman rule and, with it, the achieved wealth.</p>
        <p>Even with this explanation, however, the high number of statues erected by individuals in more or less small local sanctuaries remains surprising. Nowhere else in the Roman Empire can one find such a high concentration of single statues of Victoria or similar images glorifying Roman rule. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that all these figures were erected primarly to thank and praise the gods for Roman rule.</p>
        <p>The addition of the cornucopia also indicates an understanding of Victoria as a goddess connected with fortune and luck. These aspects were very popular in the Levantine region, as part of a religious concept, in particular in their conception of the god, or rather the divine power Gad (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3e141194-0fca-4180-89ed-406ccad71b3e">plural, Gadde</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e450"/> Gad was the pansemitic god of fortune but also a protective god of specific localities such as cities, mountains, or even houses, as well as of groups and individuals. Gad is usually depicted as a man&#8212;though there are also female depictions&#8212;and it seems as though no strict iconographic rules ever existed for him. Gad could even be represented with the iconography of other gods, but this does not mean that those gods took over the function of Gad&#8212;the iconography of those gods was simply seen as a fitting image for Gad.</p>
        <p>In this context, a closer look at the famous so-called Tyche of Antiochia (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc9a20220-ece5-4a1b-8cf0-81019e71e8a3">Fig. 9</xref>), a statue that was created in the very early third century BCE in Antiochia, on the Orontes in Syria (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID925e49b7-8d03-45ac-b6f2-9a7f57c2f679">Meyer 2006, 5-120</xref>), could be fruitful. This statue was often copied, frequently adapted, and conceived as the personification of the city, showing on the one hand a female figure with a mural crown as the personified city and, on the other hand, the natural setting of the city in the form of a rock and personified river. It was only in later years, probably not before the second century BCE, that this figure was named and seen as Tyche (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID171e8405-5d2f-4828-a5b7-9fe27eeb8f33">Meyer 2006, 335&#8211;378</xref>). According to Marion Meyer, this process has to be understood as a transfer, by which the idea of a personal Tyche was adapted into the concept of a Tyche of a specific group, namely of a city (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID063c3ddd-b155-4c04-af5c-c58ec093dfa0">Meyer 2006, 342&#8211;348</xref>). In her point of view, this process has to be seen as rooted in a Greek way of thinking (<xref rid="ID20143080-13c2-456d-aba6-a6cc5d23b2b6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4c4421dd-daaa-400e-a7d2-178e3362e0cb">Meyer 2006, 350</xref>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 9 here]</p>
        <p>However, one has to keep in mind that the local semitic concept of Gad as a protective god of individuals, groups, and locations appears to be much older. Against this background, it was probably not by chance that the concept of Tyche as a protective god of a city was developed in the Levantine region alone, even though Greek influence cannot be denied, especially concerning the visual representation of this idea. Altogether, it seems likely that the figure of the personified city Antiocheia was first interpreted by the local population as Gad of the city, before this concept was transferred, through the Greek way of thinking, to Tyche of the city.</p>
        <p>The widespread and popular belief in Gad could even be responsible for the popularity of the goddess Victoria in Roman Syria.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e484"/> Because of her iconography and her role in Roman imagery, in particular her depiction in connection with specific individuals, she might have appeared primarily as a protective goddess. She certainly remains a symbol of victory, but this concept could be easily applied to different aspects of social life and related to individual persons and groups. Thus, it seems possible that, in Roman Syria, Victoria was understood in a more general way as guarantor of a specific aspect of fortune, namely all political and private victories, the resulting wealth of which is in some cases expressed by the addition of a cornucopia to the established iconography of Victoria. From this point of view at least, the extraordinarily high number of statues of this goddess dedicated in different sanctuaries seems to be more understandable. In order to verify this idea, inscriptions could be particularly helpful.</p>

        <title>Nike/Victoria: A powerful transcultural image</title>
        <p>As mentioned above, few of the sculptures of Victoria found in Roman Syria are equipped with inscriptions and those that do have inscriptions usually only give the names of the dedicators. Thus, at present, only the iconography of the figures can be investigated in order to gain a better understanding of which beliefs and concepts were visualized with these depictions. As shown above, this method led to the assumption that, in Roman Syria, the winged goddess Nike/Victoria was most likely understood in a specific way, inspired or at least affected by local beliefs. Victoria was probably no longer exclusively seen as the divine messenger in the context of a victory, but as a personal protector of specific individuals and groups, guaranteeing their success. Presumably it was this point of view which was responsible for the goddess&#8217; extraordinary appeal, and may have been what prompted the production and veneration of such a large number number of figures of her in this region.</p>
        <p>The religious concept behind the Syrian figures of Victoria, as well as the phenomenon of their special attractiveness, seems to be relevant to the overarching research question of this volume, namely the creation, development, and visualization of winged spirits in later times, and in other regions, especially further east. Without a doubt, the image of the winged goddess Nike/Victoria was the dominating iconographic model for later depictions of angels and other winged spirits. In addition, the Roman Near East was the most important zone of contact between Asia and Europe in ancient times and therefore, without question, of great importance for conveying iconographic models between the East and the West.</p>
