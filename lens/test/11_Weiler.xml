      <title>Epilogue</title>
      <p>
        <italic>by Katharina Weiler</italic>
      </p>
      <p>Angels and auspicious and protective spirits have great potential to cross frontiers. The contributions to this volume testify to various transformative processes, the transcultural&#8212;and even transcontinental&#8212;trajectories of such beings, and the creative dialogue among the artists and architects who created them. </p>
      <p>Maybe now more than ever, such spirits are made symbols of transformation, with a magical aura, reconceptualised for everyday matters (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf34d8197-5f4c-41fd-9874-b0edf0538540">Fig. 1</xref>). Personified and visualised, celestial figures serve as a special means of communication in different kinds of media. They still qualify as a major vehicle for addressing issues of protection and salvation, but also identity and gender, class, and the advent of the information age. </p>
      <p>[Fig. 1 here]</p>
      <p>Guardian angels, for instance, are recontextualised to conform to current issues, their fields of duty constantly broadened. In doing so, a guardian angel is deployed where he or she is needed the most, for example as a protector of the climate (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1e8bfead-5fcf-4279-bfa1-84085dd7c13e">Fig. 2</xref>) or peace ambassador. </p>
      <p>[Fig. 2 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 3 here]</p>
      <p>In 2004, two years before the end of the civil war in Nepal, a picture of two girls (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5a2b2186-bd5d-4a34-880d-0d0bef4608b4">Fig. 3</xref>) was published in the daily Nepalese newspaper <italic>Kathmandu Post</italic>. According to the caption, the girls were &#8220;dressed as angels&#8221; leading a peace rally in Chitwan. The way they are depicted as a couple and bearing garlands, however, indicates that they represent hybrid aerial creatures, half wisdom bearer (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID44342e29-3f79-4776-a103-52d481291ccd">vidy&#257;dhari</xref></italic>) and half angel.</p>
      <p>In his work &#8220;Archangel Michael: And no message could have been any clearer&#8221;, the photographer David LaChapelle portrays Michael Jackson as Archangel Michael defeating Satan. The image shifts the discussion of the legend that accompanied the singer&#8217;s intricate biography and the mystery surrounding his death into a new, religious context in which the gossiped-about person becomes a divine idol who defeats the demonised monster. In this context, Jackson becomes a modern-day deity, who is built up and torn down by a community that he at the same time holds together. Finally, Taschen used the image for an advertisement (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9982505b-ae1b-4b88-ac77-dbe50c7ccbc0">Fig. 4</xref>), stating that &#8220;TASCHEN books don&#8217;t just break coffee tables, they also crash headlong through perceived barriers between high and low art.&#8221;</p>
      <p>[Fig. 4 here]</p>
      <p>Michael Jackson&#8217;s transformation into his namesake archangel exemplifies the iconographic similarities and relationships across geographical boundaries, genres, and cultural formations. </p>
      <p>The praying pose of Michael Jackson as the Archangel Michael somehow finds its modern counterpart in a different cultural context in the &#346;ri Adhya Katyani &#346;akti Pi&#7789;h Ma&#7751;&#7693;ir, popularly known as Chattarpur Temple, in Delhi, India. The temple was established in 1974, by Baba Sant Nagpal Ji, who died in 1998. An almost life-sized winged, angelic statue (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7ea23dde-d558-4c9c-b6d7-2cef8e558f98">Fig. 5</xref>) is placed on a pedestal from where the female figure welcomes the devotees and other visitors at the entrance to the guru&#8217;s mausoleum (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDeb47366a-156f-4c9f-b3d9-0729b8c50511">samadhi</xref></italic>) that lies in the premises of the &#346;iv-Gauri Nage&#347;war Ma&#7751;&#7693;ir, within the temple complex.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 5 here]</p>
      <p>Another picture of the Archangel Michael (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDde96afc0-c348-4b35-848b-361761973ff3">Fig. 6</xref>), who has guarded the Christuskirche in Mannheim, Germany since 1911, was published in June 2010, when the Vuvuzela, a wind instrument, came to be known around the globe during the Football World Cup. While the author identifies the Archangel&#8217;s instrument as a Vuvuzela, the divine statue resembles a football fan that follows a global trend.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 6 here]</p>
      <p>These examples show that the appearance or specific function of angels and their understanding is constantly being modified across time and space in a transcultural web of relationships. The same is true for contemporary representations of the Roman goddess of victory. </p>
      <p>In an ambiguous way, model Erin Heatherton (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDecd7be4d-ccc0-416a-9326-91a7c3654c3d">Fig. 7</xref>) alluded to moral and gender categories during a fashion show for the lingerie and beauty label Victoria&#8217;s Secret. By presenting models that are under &#8220;angel&#8221; contracts as winged, the designer plays with the brand&#8217;s name and the iconography of the goddess of victory while showing how seemingly contrasting articles of clothing can be combined. A leopard-patterned push-up bra is paired with a woollen hat and gloves. Heatherton, who &#8220;propagates&#8221; the message &#8220;HOPE&#8221; with her violet panties, invites the viewer&#8217;s gaze. The suggestive impact of this pictorial language appears so forcefully that, on interwoven levels of meaning and interpretation, the imagery makes further statements. Violet is a symbol for a range of things: in a clerical context, it is the liturgical colour for Advent and Lent, the colour of contemplation and penance. Violet also stands for the equal treatment of men and women within the women&#8217;s movement. Has the Roman goddess of victory, in this respect, become a projection for present-day gender issues? Regardless, behind the appearance of the goddess lies a hidden commentary: lingerie is divine and has a message!</p>
      <p>[Fig. 7 here]</p>
      <p>Images of the bronze sculpture of Victoria or &#8220;Golden Lizzy&#8221; (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID80fdd5b2-df6b-460e-8bfb-e1b8a7b946d9">Goldelse</xref></italic>), as Berliners call the statue (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID00fb3626-f170-4a1a-8183-59385f95241e">8.30m</xref>) that crowns the Berlin Victory Column, are often found in German media. The column symbolises German war victories in the past. Victoria holds a laurel wreath and army flag with the Iron Cross, her helmet decorated with an eagle. Because of the eagle, the figure may also be identified as Borussia, the personification of Prussia. Nowadays, she is a symbol of Berlin (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3f2763d7-d4c9-412f-9cc6-5f5c05db7194">Fig. 8</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8b6ce227-480f-4730-88ff-4d276aa689e0">and Berlin, in turn, is symbolic of German politics</xref>), while she also illustrates the weather forecast. </p>
      <p>Last but not least, Victoria sometimes &#8220;abandons all restraint.&#8221; In the German newspaper <italic>S&#252;ddeutsche Zeitung</italic>&#8217;s advertisement (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID861e2e91-1bd5-49bb-b369-e848a49954b2">Fig. 9</xref>) for a book series, the goddess puts down her army flag, sits comfortably cross-legged, and reads <italic>Magic Hoffmann</italic>, a book by German author Jakob Arjouni, who critiques German socitey after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The eagle joins Victoria in her reading while the sun rises in the east.</p>
      <p>[Fig. 8 here]</p>
      <p>[Fig. 9 here]</p>
      <p>The advertisement alludes not only to former eastern Germany, but to a wider East which is suggested by the rising sun, the army flag that points towards the east, and the goddess of victory&#8217;s comfortable, cross-legged position. She thus metamorphoses into a hybrid deity that adopts new forms and cultural practices.</p>
      <p>Depending on context, artist, and audience, dynamic and culturally-productive practices receive, translate, mediate, and transform images of winged, angelic figures. The angel motif has become a universal image whose iconography and role is constantly being reinvented worldwide: more than ever, it soars in transcultural skies. </p>
