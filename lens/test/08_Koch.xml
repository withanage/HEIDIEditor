      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>In this paper, I shall discuss how angels or winged spirits appear in the art of the Mughal Empire.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e46"/> The Mughals, the Muslim dynasty which was in power in India from 1526 to 1858, were paradigmatic in many of their formulations, and brilliantly expressed their ideas in the visual arts. Since they ruled as Muslim elite over a vast empire of peoples of different beliefs and cultures, they were concerned with addressing the widest possible audience and, in order to achieve this, developed a syncretistic imperial rhetoric which also informed their artistic programs. Thus following Mughal artistic interests, as is true of an investigation of winged spirits in general, will often be a cross cultural journey.</p>

      <title>The angels of the Kala Burj, Lahore Fort</title>

        <title>Transcultural iconography</title>
        <p>The concept of &#8220;auspicious&#8221; and &#8220;protective winged spirits&#8221; is common to many cultures and thus an ideal theme for transcultural investigations. In my discussion, I shall focus on the paintings of the vault of the so-called Kala Burj, at the Lahore fort, a tower pavilion which forms part of the Mughal palace complex. I discovered the paintings in December 1980 and published on them for the first time in 1983 (<xref rid="ID063d4179-869f-44eb-bf7c-ae48fab99335" ref-type="bibr" id="ID004e374a-2b4b-4fd6-aec1-1c19b2a52c86">Koch 1983</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e66"/> In the following sections, I shall outline the results of this investigation, adding new evidence and new literature, as well as new insights I have formed since then.</p>
        <p>The Kala Burj is the second tower pavilion west of a series of towers that project from the north facade of the Lahore fort. It was not the only building in the fort to be decorated with wall paintings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e75"/> The outer wall and lower part of the towers also display a rich ornamental scheme of paintings, as well as its famous figural tile work, which I shall come back to later in my discussion.</p>
        <p>The interior of the Kala Burj is dominated by the central vault (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4e2216a2-c9f7-4e1a-95d9-0abb654ea3da">Fig. 1</xref>). Above the arches and squinches of the transition zone, the vault is faced with decorative plaster work showing a system of stars or partial stars arranged in concentric circles. The stars form the knots of a geometrical network which creates kite-shaped and, within them, fan-shaped compartments. At the apex of the vault sits a medallion on a circle formed of intersecting arched ribs. Originally, the whole vault was covered with paintings which now only survive in the central area. The paintings depict birds in the stars that form the knots of the network, angels in the fan-shaped compartments, and two fighting <italic>simurgh-s</italic> (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID86024bdc-42e8-4367-9e8d-bca83dcc4d12">mythical Persian birds</xref>) in the central medallion. The facets that frame these figural paintings are filled with arabesques, flowers, and flowery ornaments.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 1 here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 2 here]</p>
        <p>The shape of the vault came into fashion in the time of Jahangir (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd2c0e42b-99f0-4e99-a715-19c969c31d24">r. 1605&#8211;1627</xref>) who undertook major alterations to the Lahore fort in his early reign. The style of the paintings also points to the early seventeenth century. There is a description of a European traveller named William Finch who visited the Lahore fort in 1610. From other reports of Europeans on Mughal palaces it appears that such visits, also to the more secluded areas, were possible when the emperor and his court were absent from the city. Finch seems to clearly refer to the Kala Burj, when he speaks of a gallery situated near the river,</p>
        <p>where the King useth to sit [there] are drawne overhead many pictures of angels, with pictures of Banian dews &#8230;, or rather divels, intermixt in most ugly shape with long hornes, staring eyes, shagge haire, great fangs, ugly pawes, long tailes, with such horrible difformity and deformity that I wonder the poore women are not frighted therewith (<xref rid="ID0cce772d-4f37-4aab-9a1a-916044c5f0cb" ref-type="bibr" id="ID944b34c1-48ae-40f4-9169-acc7639c7208">Finch 1921, 163&#8211;64</xref>).</p>
        <p>Part of the &#8220;many pictures of angels&#8221; which Finch would have seen &#8220;drawne overhead&#8221; survive in the central area of the vault, but no trace is left of what he described as &#8220;Banian dews.&#8221; We shall come back to them later.</p>
        <p>The program of the paintings, which depicts a heavenly vault of concentric spheres demarcated by stars and populated by winged beings, implies a celestial region. The fan-shaped compartments and the medallion of the apex are set off by blue color and by little clouds, as sections of heaven.</p>
        <p>What is left of the paintings impresses the viewer with its quality. The angels are among the most original creations Mughal art has brought forth in this genre. They do not follow the traditional Iranian-Mughal type of winged beings dressed in long floating garments, but are clearly derived from a European prototype, namely the boyish (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9c5a93ec-5761-4857-8c2a-c962fc2d13b9">half-</xref>)nude putto image, which had been revived in the Italian Renaissance Quattrocento, as a conscious imitation of classical Eros figures. Such winged infants became an indispensable element of European art iconography; they appeared as angels in religious works, and as putti in secular representations. The latter were mostly of an allegoric or symbolic nature.</p>
        <p>The putto angel had been introduced into Mughal art through pictorial material brought to court by the Jesuit missions from about 1580 onwards. These depictions of putti were, to a large extent, engravings, often from the print shops of Antwerp, specially produced for Jesuit requirements, as part of their Counter Reformation and mission activities.</p>
        <p>The winged child angel head, a form reduced from the concept of the cherub who has wings instead of arms, entered Mughal art for the first time through the same sources.</p>
        <p>The European adolescent angel, which dates back to early medieval Christianity and Roman <italic>victoriae</italic>, was also taken from Christian engravings. Similar in concept, this type was particularly suitable to fuse with or supplant the traditional Iranian-Mughal child angel.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 3 here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 4 here]</p>
        <p>The three European types of winged beings became predominant in the art of Jahangir, as well. The European angels were either copied in their original context (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID23961093-1036-43b6-b592-e7b6fd01777a">Fig. 2</xref>), or took the place of the Iranian-Mughal angelfigure in traditional programs, like the winged spirits serving the Koranic prophet king Sulaiman (<xref rid="ID7fb325f8-b494-4ca7-a5a2-63a9d49b0e56" ref-type="bibr" id="ID54033f7d-06f4-481d-a1c0-b321b669090b">Solomon</xref>), or as putti, transplanted into a new pictorial setting, the Mughal allegory, which was created by Jahangir, his artistic advisers, and his artists. This representation is a characteristic Mughal hybrid visually expressing Jahangir&#8217;s concept of rulership by means of compositional techniques derived from European allegories. To this end, European forms underwent a Mughalization, were used along with more traditional Mughal forms realized with European stylistic techniques.</p>
        <p>The angel cycle of the Kala Burj is a vivid demonstration of this transformative process. It shows, simultaneously, the above-mentioned stages of angel depiction, from only slightly transformed Mughal copies of European models to Europeanized Mughal images, all of which are characteristic of the creative dialogue between Mughal and European art at the time of Jahangir.</p>
        <p>Among the preserved angels, the most faithful copy of a European model is the angel in the innermost circle, holding a red scroll with <italic>nasta</italic>c<italic>liq</italic> characters (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb949682e-7efc-462d-9d20-8d212fb6a409">Fig. 3</xref>). The typical putto with bent legs is close to the one flying in the top center of the Mughal copy of the Descent from the Cross, 1598, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6dde8288-6337-4901-ba00-5e9ebe03e624">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1ae44dd5-ae11-4960-abe1-30c1537e9a5b">Stronge 2002, 111, pl. 77 and Koch 2001, fig. 2.14</xref>). Robert Skelton suggested that this picture of the deposition may have been the one seen by the Jesuit father Jerome Xavier at Lahore, when it was painted under the supervision of Prince Salim, later Jahangir (<xref rid="IDa2928ef1-9392-4839-ba20-03d14271e13a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdc6c8214-eafe-4a4f-a69e-e2eea275d561">Skelton 1969, 43-44</xref>). It demonstrates Jahangir&#8217;s interest in the subject when he was still a prince. The Lahore connection is also noteworthy. The Kala Burj angel has retained the chubbiness of its European prototype. The carefully observed naturalistic details of the feathers of his wings, though only partly preserved, recall the best creations of this genre in Mughal painting, namely the bird studies of <italic>ustad</italic> Mansur and his circle. Even without knowing the exact European prototype, we realize that his large eyes and their intense look are also a Mughal contribution to the original concept, as are his cap and the <italic>nasta</italic>c<italic>liq</italic> characters on the scroll. The scroll&#8217;s text offers no coherent meaning and was intended only to indicate the character of the scroll as a carrier of writing, pseudo writing being a common practice of calligraphic decoration in Islamic art.</p>
        <p>Closely patterned after a European original, but even more estranged by his accessories, is the angel with ruby and pearl earrings and a European hat (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf8ef32ab-4d9f-49f9-ac4c-acfaf10de9b8">Fig. 4</xref>). This headgear, though European, is not used by his European counterparts at all. A potential source for this angel is found on an engraving known to have been in the possession of the Mughal emperors, namely the dedication page of the famous Antwerp Polyglot Bible, presented in 1580 to Akbar (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc9b01cd8-166e-4c0f-b287-414c2934b5cc">r. 1556&#8211;1605</xref>) by the first Jesuit mission: the flying putto who holds a laurel wreath and a palm branch over the head of Pietas Regia, the personification of the piety of Philip II of Spain, the sponsor of this Bible edition (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID57e3c18f-05e6-467a-87d5-43668e034f34">Koch 2001, figs 1.2 and 2.15</xref>). The Mughal version of this putto is again more athletic than his model and his large, pink wings bear minute distinctions in the texture and pattern of the different feathers. The angel&#8217;s arms, which he holds in front of his body, as well as the position of his fingers, indicate that he was supposed to hold something like a string. The composition is very fine and is the most complete among those which have been preserved. The whole background, with the sky and the little clouds, is still visible.</p>
        <p>These two types of angels served as the basic model for most of the other angels of the vault, who appear in different states of preservation. Generally, the model was only used for the pose of the body (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5c0c5110-07e1-4656-814a-405d8c3ec0ef">the legs in particular</xref>), upon which angel images of different types were superimposed. The angels wear bizarre headgear, mostly caps of different shapes, and carry different objects like fruit bowls, green feathers, or twigs. One dark angel wears a floral wreath and holds a turban with cross bands, of the distinctive shape designed by emperor Humayun (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4dd09e0f-6b9a-4e63-8244-4592cf742d4d">Fig. 1, left</xref>).</p>
        <p>Lastly, an angel in the second circle holds a long-necked bottle and a cup. Of all the angels preserved, he is the one with the least &#8220;outlandish&#8221; appearance (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdbcf4eca-790b-45fa-98e3-63e7f040f8f7">Fig. 1, further left</xref>). The youthful Mughal cupbearer, the <italic>saqi</italic>, is raised to the status of an angel and his nude, well-modelled torso lends him a new physical presence.</p>
        <p>Two winged angel heads still preserved in the second circle again represent a purely European concept that had no precedent at all in the Islamic painting tradition (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2bd8d7b3-7214-407d-aa60-3999e27a70f0">Fig. 1, right</xref>). Such cherubim became great favorites with Jahangir. They appear especially in paintings directly related to the emperor, such as the well-known political allegory of Jahangir embracing Shah Abbas, of about 1618&#8211;1620, now housed in the Freer Gallery, Washington DC. There, winged angels&#8217; heads not only support the great sun and moon halo of Jahangir, but also appear in minute form as a golden ornament on his green waistcoat.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e194"/>
            </p>
        <p>The central medallion of the Kala Burj creates the illusionistic impression of an opening in the vault to the blue sky, where a pink and a green <italic>simurgh</italic>, both with long gold, green, and red tail feathers, are engaged in a fight. This dynamic concept comes close to Mughal marginal drawings&#8212;<italic>hashiyah</italic>-<italic>s</italic>&#8212;which are a traditional domain of the aggressive <italic>simurgh</italic>. Mughal marginal illustrations and architectural decorations show similar motifs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e217"/>

        <title>The angels of the Lahore Fort as actors in a Solomonic program</title>
        <p>This elaborate program of angels and birds of the Kala Burj leads us to the question of why it is featured in the vault of a palace building of the Mughal emperor Jahangir. The obvious intention, one would think, was to characterize the reception hall, the <italic>diwan khana</italic> of Jahangir&#8217;s private apartments, as a heavenly palace. This in any case would have been the most traditional way to denote the dwelling of a Muslim ruler. A problem arises in view of several features of the representation, such as the eccentric headgear of the angels and the specific activities in which they seem to be engaged, which cannot be explained by this general interpretation.. If a more specific program was expressed in these paintings, then we may ask further whether the fact that it was realized with predominantly European forms has a special significance, given Jahangir&#8217;s pronounced interest in European themes and styles.</p>
        <p>The evidence in surviving monuments and representations of palace buildings in miniature painting shows that angels or winged beings, birds, and <italic>simurgh-s</italic> belong to the traditional stock of images used to decorate the setting of an Islamic ruler. These images appear either as individual motifs or feature in pictorial programs that may also include fights of real or mythical animals and birds, beasts, birds of prey descending on their respective victims, or predators and their potential victims in peaceful coexistence. The tradition of these motifs and themes as symbols of rulership and the paradisiacal setting of the ruler has been investigated in Iran and the world of greater Persianate culture by Ingeborg Luschey-Schmeisser, in her study of the 1670 tile cycle of the Hasht Behisht pavilion, in Isphahan (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDda68ddb7-ebc7-44ff-94f9-e5972eca2af1">Luschey-Schmeisser 1978, 47&#8211;55</xref>). She interprets winged beings in connection with Muslim rulers as symbols of victory and power going back to the <italic>victoriae</italic> of classical times. She further views them as an expression of rulership in search of blessings from the angels, and as winged beings which protect and serve the ruler.</p>
        <p>We have seen that Jahangir had a general inclination to be depicted in the company of (<xref rid="ID063d4179-869f-44eb-bf7c-ae48fab99335" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf393c54a-d0fa-46e6-9782-3e31ce3eb4f4">European</xref>) angels. His angels in the Kala Burj, however, were actors in a very specific setting, deeply embedded in the mythology of Islamic rulership. No other Islamic ruler beside Jahangir, however, had given this concept such a naturalistic and individual expression.</p>
        <p>The key for our interpretation is provided, though unintentionally so, by William Finch who, as we remember, expressed his astonishment about the &#8220;Banian dews or rather divels&#8221; populating the vault with the angels. (As no trace of them remains, they must have been set in the lower compartments of the outer circle.) From Finch&#8217;s reaction, we can deduce that they must have been represented as naturalistically as the angels, for he was amazed that the &#8220;poor women&#8221; of the <italic>zananah</italic> were not frightened by viewing such monstrous images. Not familiar with the symbolic images of the mythology of Islamic rulers, Finch did not realize that, far from being a cause of horror, these depictions were, on the contrary, a source of elation and reassurance to the female inmates of the palace. For Finch&#8217;s &#8220;Banian dews&#8221; were, of course, no other than the <italic>diws</italic> or <italic>jinn</italic> of Sulaiman bin Dawud (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID23b7c192-f5e7-483b-8d64-e1ce9028d8e1">Solomon, the son of David</xref>), the archetypal ruler of the Koran and prophet king who, by divine assistance, rules over the seen and unseen world. Countless myths and legends have developed around this Koranic figure. All sources elaborate on the fact that he was granted command over the demons, <italic>jinn</italic>, which he controlled with the divine seal on his ring and the assistance of the angels, who disciplined the unruly ones or put them in irons.</p>
        <p>Among the animal subjects of Sulaiman, the birds are especially prominent, with the Koranic <italic>huhud</italic> (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa2cb3510-2a30-44b1-9872-cd99d948e716">hoopoe</xref>) as his messenger to the Queen of Sheba. Based on these Koranic passages and legends, a special Solomonic iconography developed in Islamic painting. The most frequent representation is that of Sulaiman on his throne surrounded by angels who have acquired the position of his servants, the subjected <italic>jinn</italic>, the birds led by the <italic>simurgh</italic> (&#8220;the king of the birds,&#8221; <italic>shah-i murghan</italic>), and his other animal subjects. In the Persianate world, angels are designated as <italic>paris</italic>&#8212;fairies, or positive winged spirits&#8212;and the demons as <italic>diws</italic>.</p>
        <p>A variation of this theme, particularly relevant in our context, is Sulaiman on his flying throne.  Carried with him through the air by angels or <italic>pari</italic>s and <italic>jinn</italic> or <italic>diws</italic> between puffy clouds (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa45ec7b8-e6c5-44c9-8bf2-ed1130e06e0f">compare Gutschow Fig. 12a in this volume</xref>) are the necessities of Sulaiman&#8217;s princely household and those animals which cannot fly, such as deer or ibex, as well as those which cannot fly very well, e.g. the house duck (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID66483b08-6c99-494b-971c-08fa1ea1935d">goose</xref>) and the peacock (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfdcb053f-63d0-4f74-8976-eb62788960bb">Fig. 5</xref>). The birds, along with the <italic>simurgh </italic>and the <italic>huhud</italic>,complete Sulaiman&#8217;s flying retinue. In the decoration of palaces and painted architecture, we often find individual winged beings which have apparently been taken out of this pictorial context.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e348"/> These beings still carry their respective fruit bowls, ibexes, peacocks, and the like that now acquire the quality of attributes, to denote those who carry them as Solomonic angels (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID075b415b-c9a2-4840-8a8b-99450d538548">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>Each Islamic ruler compared himself with Solomon/Sulaiman to the extent that an automatic association with Solomon developed for all themes, myths, and ideas which pertained to the life of a prince and his environment. The Mughal emperors, Jahangir among them, were no exception. The poets celebrate Jahangir as Solomon and Nur Jahan as Bilqis, the Queen of Sheeba.</p>
        <p>These literary associations with Solomon were also expressed in visual images. No literary metaphor can be as particularized as a picture must be, hence the same theme can be illustrated in many different ways. This consideration is particularly relevant in our context because Jahangir, or the persons responsible for his artistic programs, used the same Solomonic theme, not only in the interior of the palace, but also on its exterior.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 5 here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 6 here]</p>
        <p>The famous tile decoration of the outer walls of the Lahore Fort contains clear Solomonic allusions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e382"/> The tile panels which originally covered the whole northern facade, as well as the northern part of the western facade, survive only in fragments. The preserved panels depict scenes of Mughal court life of that particular historical period, along with ahistorical symbols of rulership, such as mythical animals, beasts of prey descending on their victims, and the like, as were already briefly discussed. In the spandrels of the arched openings or blind arches of the upper zone of the west wall, we find angels/<italic>paris</italic> with Solomonic attributes leading subjugated demons (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5a1fd201-2a2c-46e7-9802-37b8c7a5f68c">Fig. 7</xref>). Nearby, two little <italic>jinn</italic> or <italic>diws</italic> dance to the sound of their tambourines, giving these representations the significance of the court of a <italic>shah</italic> 
               <italic>Sulaiman hasham</italic> (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID71ae516a-fdac-43d0-94c9-58613424d796">a ruler with the retinue of Solomon</xref>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 7 here]</p>

        <p>The Solomonic angels, or <italic>paris,</italic> on the outer wall are realized in a more conservative medium (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDeb029a5c-2d90-4c53-8f17-19ddedbf03fc">tile mosaic</xref>) and style. Most are derived from the traditional Iranian angel type, with a crown-like cap and long floating garments. They carry sunshades, branches with <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID24819c4f-ff64-4782-ba27-f83725799733">fruit</xref>, and lambs, and are surrounded by birds and Chinese-style clouds that appear &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; when compared to the newer, European-style clouds found in the Kala Burj vault. In other words, these angels are characterized as carriers of the flying household of Sulaiman. Concessions to Jahangir&#8217;s taste in this traditional setting can be found in certain Europeanisms, like the turned-up feet of some angels, which suggest a perspective from above, and the introduction of his favorite cherub heads. There is also a <italic>saqi</italic> angel who, despite being fully dressed, wears a cap similar to that of his counterpart in the interior. Eccentric head coverings, including leaf bunches, are a characteristic though not exclusive feature of Solomonic angels. The flower wreath worn by the dark angel and the European hat (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID19f84c49-1356-415f-a517-e8d00bcd53f0">kulah-i firangi</xref></italic>) of the angel whom we named after his unusual headgear seem to be modern expressions of this established iconographic tradition. Though it is not clear in every instance which objects the angels of the Kala Burj are carrying, we recognize the traditional (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8040a671-f4a0-48d9-8c7b-866d5d2b28b0">fruit</xref>) plate. The green stalks in the hands of one of the angels might have been flowery twigs or the like. Knowing Jahangir&#8217;s inclination to materialize his symbolic settings, it is tempting to conjecture that real (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID07868827-f77a-4873-9f07-dacd6fb90712">gold</xref>) chains were fixed to the hands of the angel with the <italic>firangi</italic> hat, to make him lead one of the <italic>jinn</italic>/<italic>diws</italic> (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID57868c67-7c9c-4358-97ef-043d1604663a">Fig. 4</xref>). Evidence in a comparable installation in the vault of Palladio&#8217;s villa Maser in the Veneto (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe962d8e6-0293-43e2-b1bc-12b75fc29124">ca. 1560</xref>), where a painted putto holds a real lamp, confirms this.</p>
        <p>We may therefore conclude that the paintings in the vault of the Kala Burj represent the flying retinue of Jahangir as a second Solomon/Sulaiman<italic>. </italic>Conforming to the iconographic tradition of Solomonic angels, his winged servants wear eccentric headgear, some of them styled after the latest <italic>firangi</italic> taste of the Mughal court. They carry (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID942bd0ff-8053-40f0-86a8-66cdb55a0bc2">fruit</xref>) plates and other objects of the Solomonic household and may even have led the now lost demons with real chains. The birds, including his messenger <italic>hudhud</italic>, complete Sulaiman&#8217;s winged subjects (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe456d4e8-be53-4c2b-8f79-80a1e29cfd70">only partly preserved, in the left star of Fig. 4</xref>). Their leader, the <italic>simurgh</italic>, undertakes an excursion into another iconographic tradition in the central medallion, by doubling up and engaging himself with his dark alter ego in the symbolic fight which has become a symbol a ruler&#8217;s victory and power.</p>
        <p>That Jahangir associated himself with Sulaiman on his flying throne and even used it as a figure of speech is evident from the autobiographical history of his reign. When, in the spring 1618, he was keen to leave the city Ahmedabad in Gujarat, where he had fallen ill, he wrote:</p>
        <p>If the rainy season had not prevented me, I would not have delayed one day in this abode of trouble but, like Solomon (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6ee86a2b-3588-4f14-abdc-d7c7d1d54af6">Sulaiman-var</xref></italic>), would have seated myself on the throne of the wind (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2882b95b-1802-4a4c-a903-7d1870ff3261">takht-i bad</xref></italic>), and hastened out (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1b82f81f-9196-40af-a26f-79cc8995de94">Jahangir 1994, vol. 2, 13</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e487"/>
            </p>
        <p>There remains the question of why, in contrast to the traditional angels derived from the Persian type on the outer fort wall, angels after a European prototype were chosen for the interior of the palace. The outer representations were meant to appeal to a much wider and conservative public than those in the private reception hall of the emperor. Here, Jahangir&#8217;s taste as a connoisseur of painting demanded to be satisfied with the latest achievements of painters, the adaptation of European prototypes to Mughal taste, and symbolic function.</p>
        <p>One appeal of the European prototypes was certainly their realism and illusionism. The use of the European form as the most naturalistic one available seems to have had the function of investing the symbol with the greatest possible degree of reality in order to, as Abu&#8217;l Fazl&#8217;s said, &#8220;lead the ones who consider only the outside of the things to the place of inner meaning&#8221; (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8a9de2b9-cd4d-4978-a61a-49ec0c2cf9ea">cAllami 1867&#8211;77, vol. 1, 111</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e520"/>. Jahangir&#8217;s painters succeeded. They created such a vivid Solomonic atmosphere for the emperor that even the <italic>firangi</italic> Finch credited it with the power of being taken for real.</p>
        <p>These naturalistic pictorial expressions of a ruler&#8217;s asserted mythology are Jahangir&#8217;s own contribution to Mughal painting. The vault of the Kala Burj is not an isolated phenomenon, but forms part of a wider iconographic program. We find the idea expressed in the painted vaults of the pavilions of the Rambagh at Agra. Known collectively as Nur Afshan garden, they belonged to the quarters of Jahangir&#8217;s wife Nur Jahan (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8cb1d049-4dd1-44e8-972a-7591b47f8e17">completed before 1621</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDff915ccb-e442-4aac-8b9b-3a903c002af3">Koch 2001, fig. 2.21</xref>; <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd5483b03-f03a-49a7-b8c9-afff475c9f9a">Koch 2006, fig. 37</xref>). Here, the vaults are populated by birds and winged beings holding various objects, like fruit plates and, in one case, a peacock (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb6045c4b-7aad-4b33-9d42-af3284d19da3">Fig. 6</xref>). Such painted programs apparently decorated most of Jahangir&#8217;s palaces, and echoes of them also appear in the decorations of tombs, such as the cherub head and <italic>pari</italic> at the entrance vault of the tomb of Khusrau, Jahangir&#8217;s unfortunate eldest son, at Allahabad (<xref rid="ID65d648ad-86bb-4c3f-85a6-1642776b6d23" ref-type="bibr" id="ID24d4894f-6f0d-45c2-81e2-0a710d006de1">1621&#8211;1622</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3ab48fdc-2a8b-438e-9093-1ec5fb3215ed">Koch 2001, fig. 2.22</xref>).</p>

        <title>Post-Jahangiri Solomonic iconographies</title>
        <p>Such figural wall paintings were abandoned in Shah Jahan&#8217;s art, with the exception of the Solomonic decoration of birds and lions, and the panel of Orpheus (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1b95fc3f-220e-46f2-a126-a23a191e2247">reinterpreted as a Solomonic symbol</xref>) on the wall behind the throne <italic>jharoka</italic> at Delhi, &#8220;painted in stone,&#8221; that is inlayed with semi-precious stones or <italic>pietra dura</italic> (<xref rid="ID063d4179-869f-44eb-bf7c-ae48fab99335" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe7dc71c6-d2f2-48e9-9a01-f11c37db93fa">Koch 2001,61&#8211;129</xref>). However, the miniature painters continued to draw from stocks of these images. The painted <italic>jharoka</italic>-<italic>s</italic> of Shah Jahan&#8217;s court scenes and the walls from which they are projecting were still decorated with angels and birds (Beach, Koch and Thackston 1997, cat. no. 44 and Topsfield 2008, cat. no. 33).</p>

These paintings took up Jahangir&#8217;s angel/<italic>pari</italic> theme of the fort. The reference here is made to the more conservative angel type dressed in a long garment and placed on the outer wall (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID99bfa1dc-fe09-4dac-a839-0047cbb720f8">compare Fig. 8 with Fig. 7</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e599"/>

        <p>Jahangir&#8217;s Solomonic vaults clearly influenced the courts of Rajasthan, who followed the lead of the Mughal emperors. Winged beings appear on the painted vaults of the palace in Bairat, which dates from the first quarter of the seventeenth century. These representations also include images of winged <italic>jinn</italic> holding birds (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID62448cda-879d-402b-a582-bade0f653838">Koch 2001, fig. 2.23</xref>). We find adaptions and transformations of the theme in the palace Govind Mahal of Bir Singh Dev at Datia in Bundelkandh, ca. 1620-27,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e613"/> and in the eighteenth/nineteenth century fort of Nagaur. At Nagaur, several ceiling paintings depict large roundels, in which angels or winged spirits wearing long garments form circular whirls. Putti also appear here, demonstrating that, even at this late date, the full Jahangiri repertoire was still remembered and taken into consideration (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID81ecfc15-b651-4529-a93d-ad4a696cbb96">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
        <p>[Fig. 10 here]</p>
        <p>A very creative transcultural amalgam appeared in the third quarter of the seventeenth century, in the marble pavilions of the Rana of Udaipur Raj Singh, arranged on the stepped terraces of the dam of the Raj Samand, in Kankroli. The pavilions are replicas of the Mughal pavilions built by Jahangir and Shah Jahan at Ajmer, before 1637, but the plain ceilings of the latter are replaced by ceilings in marble relief showing angels, birds, and a <italic>simurgh,</italic> amid a heaven of Hindu gods (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID10b4357c-33a9-482e-97c6-cb19c611be31">Fig. 10</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6297dc20-8e55-4fc7-bc98-c9b0bfedfcf7">Goetz 1978, 102, pl. xxxi, 8/16 and 8/17</xref>). A more distant though clear reference to the Solomonic programs of Jahangir is found in the wooden temples of Ahmadabad, from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The highly original brackets of the Ajitn&#257;th Derasar (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID07bcb4fd-616e-4931-8beb-d03beed6134a">1799 CE</xref>) at Waghan Pol, discussed by Rabindra Vasavada in this volume, have the form of winged spirits carrying musical instruments, and those of the Monk&#8217;s residences (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa76a3afc-df3c-4c6e-bcad-ca3969f97aa3">1871</xref>) of the complex of the Sv&#257;min&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a Temple at Kalupur, built in 1822, show <italic>paris</italic> intertwined <italic>with</italic>

        <title>Wider echoes of Jahangir&#8217;s Solomonic vaults</title>
        <p>Ten years after its publication, Priscilla Soucek used my reading of the angels of the Kala Burj as a hermeneutic model to identify related themes in Umayyad and Qajar art. That model led her to &#8220;consider whether the complex at Khirabt al-Mafjar was intended to portray a member of the Umayyad dynasty, possible Walid b. Yazid, in the guise of Solomon and his retinue&#8221; (<xref rid="ID9fd3bbe1-a3a8-46b0-93d6-09c40c2e1afc" ref-type="bibr" id="ID650d945d-fcaf-4d90-ade1-60c48d737a4d">Soucek 1993, 122</xref>). Soucek felt that several of the features of the sculptural ensemble which decorates the palace indicate a Solomonic program, more specifically of a projection of a flying Solomonic retinue including birds, lions, other animals, and human figures, which have landed on the palace complex, with the ruler standing on a lion-protected throne in the center.</p>
        <p>To turn to Mughal art to explain a phenomenon of Umayyad art stands to reason. I would even go so far as to claim that formulations of Mughal art are often indispensable to understanding earlier or later ideas in Islamic art. In its first phase, Mughal art was characterized by the amalgamation of the Mughals&#8217; Timurid heritage with local Hindustani traditions; soon after, the Mughals also began to look westward and to the distant past for inspiration for their artistic and imperial formulations. With their clear and rational approach, the Mughals more clearly defined and systematized ideas which had been more vaguely expressed in the traditions from which they drew their inspiration; they aestheticized these ideas with their unrivalled talent for visual articulation and universalized them by successfully merging them with related features of other traditions.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 11 here]</p>
        <p>At the same time, the reception of Jahangir&#8217;s Solomonic angels in Qajar art, which forms part of a wider though largely neglected trend, is not surprising. Mughal India was on the receiving side of external cultural influence in the sixteenth century but, by the end of the seventeenth century, the tables turned and Iran looked to Mughal India for artistic inspiration. This reversal is especially apparent in the arts of the Qajar dynasty, which show evidence of strong historic as well as Indian interest. A throne in the Gulistan Palace in Teheran, the so-called Takht-i Marmar, or marble throne, was created during the reign of Fath Ali Shah (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID962a3ab1-3b02-4cb6-b623-42b7683eb6e3">r. 1797&#8211;1833</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe8a104ca-c0dc-45f0-b737-223e4416521e">Fig. 11</xref>) (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4d5a8962-ba79-4129-a0f8-c73de1e5d6e5">Soucek 1993, 120&#8211;121, figs. 6 and 7</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e685"/> This throne consists of a platform supported by columns and figures. Three of the figures are <italic>diws</italic>, two are young men, and four are young women holding pieces of fruits and flowering twigs. Lions also appear on the steps. The throne has an inscription which identifies it as a Solomonic throne and relates it to Fath Ali Shah, as the Solomon of the Age (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0b1ac672-7c77-4fc8-b42e-de1a2849a968">Sulaiman-i zaman</xref></italic>). The supporting figures are described as <italic>paris</italic> and <italic>diws</italic>. While they have no wings, they are clearly intended as the carriers of the flying throne of Sulaiman. The painted iconography is translated into three-dimensional marble sculptures with an implied performance aspect; when the ruler sat down on the throne, he became a new Solomon. The lions on the steps refer to another Solomonic throne which was also protected by lions and featured birds.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e708"/>
            </p>
        <p>The examples presented here provide insight into the role of winged beings in the mythology and symbolism of ruler representation. They demonstrate that such creatures, although recognizable, were not static but capable of adaptation, and of undertaking the most amazing and unlikely transcultural and transcontinental journeys.</p>
        <p>There could be no better way to conclude this discussion than with the video of the contemporary Pakistani artist Shahzia Sikander entitled SpiNN (<xref rid="IDb992569b-4496-47e5-880a-c3fa1a28f2e5" ref-type="bibr" id="IDda72c422-b1a8-40f7-8599-0f4eeb3b9f7e">Sikander 2003</xref>). Sikander created the video using her characteristic, miniature painting technique, with which she comes amazingly close to the Mughal original but then transforms it, giving it her own interpretation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e721"/> To this end, she engages in an unusual and creative dialogue with the hermeneutics of art history by taking inspiration from my article about the Lahore angels,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e727"/> and from another publication, the exhibition catalogue of the paintings of the so-called Windsor Castle <italic>Padshahnama</italic>,which illustrate the history of Shah Jahan (<xref rid="IDf46a0d66-39a8-42f2-a8bf-f44e7b106b5e" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0280d17c-ca76-4631-a0fe-c456ea64f7f4">Beach, Koch and Thackston 1997</xref>). From the latter, Shahzia Sikander copied the <italic>jharoka</italic>, the viewing loggia of a court reception scene (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5e0e93a9-b353-4a63-aa1d-834134e05c0d">Beach, Koch and Thackston. 1997, cat. no. 9</xref>) but left out the figures of Emperor Jahangir embracing his son Prince Khurram (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID50e2e7c5-e6ed-4c1c-891b-d711afda1a5b">the later Shah Jahan</xref>) and the attending courtiers. Instead, she introduced the blue god Krishna on a composite horse and, after him, gopis, the cow-herd girl companions of Krishna, whose hair separates from their heads, transforms into bat-like shapes and gathers in a swarm.
