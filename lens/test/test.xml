        <p>Photography and East Asian ports formed an inextricably tight relationship during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Initially launched by Western photographers, photography in East Asian treaty ports captured exotic customs and landscapes of East Asia and was an indispensable part of the newly emerging culture of port cities. In Japan, the tourist photography industry was established in the mid-nineteenth century at treaty ports and flourished as an ever growing industry until the beginning of the twentieth century. Catering exclusively to the non-Japanese audience in the West, this photographic industry cultivated a parallel image culture to the indigenous photography scene with its distinctive iconographic repertoire and its particular visual aesthetics.</p>
        <p>Conditioned by transport technologies, the profile of the foreign clientele of this image industry was never monolithic, and experienced a radical shift in the course of its history, especially since the rise of the globetrotter tourism in the early 1870s. This very fact invites us to question how tourist photography as a commercial commodity responded to its changing circumstances and how the industry’s reaction was reflected in its visual imagination. My analysis focuses on clarifying the complex web of movements of people (photographers, customers of photographic images) in port cities and visual products (photography) within the context of the port city tourist industry, showing how this dynamic was embodied in the intricate strategy of its photographic imaginations.</p>
        <p>By taking the tourist photography industry in Yokohama as an example, this paper illustrates how it was launched as a business emblematic of nineteenth-century European and American entrepreneurship in East Asia, and how it developed a unique image culture that spread from the port city of Yokohama to Europe, the US, and Australia. It also looks into its visual language and illuminate how this commercial image industry consciously related its geographical, historical, economic, and cultural specificity to its visual products. By doing so, I aim to demonstrate that photography, in this regard, proves to be a cultural artifact mirroring complex interconnections taking place in the nineteenth-century port city of Yokohama.</p>

    <sec id="s1" sec-type="introduction">
      <p>In the nineteenth-century, photography was a vigorous pioneer at the frontiers of changing society.[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>] The pervasiveness of photography during the mid-nineteenth century, even in distant places, was recorded by an anonymous author who declared in a review of an exhibition of commercial stereoscopic photographs: "[A]s … the camera became more common in Egypt and the Holy Land, the more adventurous photographers turned their steps to more distant and less known countries. Even the jealously-guarded countries of China and Japan cannot shut out the camera."[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref>]] As the first gateway to remote places, ports formed an inextricably bound relationship with photography during the latter half of the nineteenth century, especially in Asia. An increasing interest in the exotic meant that the commercial potential for photography with its overwhelming realism and visual sensation emerged as a popular means of capturing the 'Other.'</p>
      <p>The souvenir photography industry in Japan was initially established in the mid-nineteenth century by Western photographers at Treaty Ports like Yokohama. There it flourished as an industry that provided seemingly 'authentic,' and visually convincing pictures. Catering to a non-Japanese audience, this photographic industry cultivated an alternative image culture to the indigenous photography scene, which had its own distinctive iconographic repertoire and visual languages. These distinct image cultures continued their parallel lives until the decline of the image industry, which was triggered by the fierce price competition against privately produced postcards after the relaxation of postal laws at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
      <p>The desire for and the gaze in the visualization of the "Other" changed during the course of the history of Japanese souvenir photography. In the case of the souvenir photography industry in the port city of Yokohama, for example, the Japanese-owned photographic studios had by the 1880s supplanted the dominant Western photographers. Aided by transport technologies, the profile of the foreign clientele for this image industry was never monolithic, and it experienced a radical shift through the course of its history, especially after the rise of globetrotter tourism in the early 1870s. As a commercial commodity, souvenir photography needed to respond to its changing circumstances. As both a constructed visual object―not a "transparently 'authentic' image"[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref>] of Japan―and a commercial commodity intended to meet customers' expectations, souvenir photography was a complex cultural product. It is this which invites us to question how the shifting gaze of the photographer and his audience transformed the visual imagination. At the same time, the nineteenth-century port city of Yokohama held an ambiguous position as both a venue of "connections"―bringing people, goods, and ideas together as well as generating diverse cross-cultural memories―and (almost predestined by its beginning as a Treaty Port city and later actively promoted by diverse factors) as a symbolic and physical space of cultural 'disconnectedness' from the rest of Japan. This was realized in a manner that was similar to the relationship between the Shanghai International Settlement and inland China. It is this very aspect that begs us to consider the following complex issues: To what extent was the ambivalent facet of the city embedded in the visual representation of Yokohama? In which ways did the resultant unstable memories and perceptions among audiences with shifting profiles affect image creators? How were the differences in perspective between customers and photographers, that is, between the changing generations of recipients as well as between the photographers active in different phases, negotiated in the image-making processes?</p>
      <p>Using the examples of nineteenth-century Yokohama souvenir photography taken by Felice Beato and Kusakabe Kimbei, I aim to investigate how photographic images of Yokohama could be read as mirroring the dynamics of these shifting relationships and perspectives. A particular focus will be on Yokohama as a physical site, on Yokohama as a site of transition, and on the corporeality of the onsite experience of the audience. The dynamics of the port city as a place of disconnections/connections will be at the center of my discussion. In the process, I will delineate the changing associations of the port city of Yokohama as a site of both image creation and consumption, factors which in their turn led to shifting conditions for Yokohama souvenir photography within and beyond the port city. My aim is to specify how these shifting conditions, such as the development of "globetrotter" tourism, shaped the rhetoric of visual representation. In contrast to most discussions of the tourist gaze, in which the main focus is primarily on the techniques of visual representation[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref>] or the constitution of the gazing subject,[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref>] this study will highlight the embodied experiences of photography's audiences, the technological advancements in photographic media and transportation, as well as the changing methods of image acquisition. In this I will build on a suggestion by Mike Crang that corporeality of experience is a key aspect within the photographic representation of tourist landscape because it "serves to highlight the mediation of visual worlds through technologies and epistemologies."[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref>] This paper will thus explore the multifaceted and changing aspects of Yokohama photography and its image-making practices in constant dialogue with the changing conditions of the photographers themselves, as well as of the port city, of travel, and of photographic technology.[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">7</xref>]</p>

      <title>The souvenir photography industry in Yokohama</title>
      <p>After Commodore Perry's arrival in 1853 and the subsequent end of Japan's policy of national seclusion, the United States–Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed in 1858 with the stipulation that Japan would open five Treaty Ports for foreign commerce and settlement in the following year. Once a sleepy village with no more than eighty to ninety houses (around 400 inhabitants) [<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">8</xref>], Yokohama―one of the five Treaty Ports―emerged as the most important of these due to its closeness to the capital city (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). By 1867 Yokohama had grown into "the great centre of foreign traffic in Japan […] [due to its] facility of communication from abroad, and […] its position on the seaboard of the central portion of the empire."[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">9</xref>] By 1864 Yokohama was already handling over eighty percent of Japan's total exports and was well on its way to becoming the largest and the most frequented of all open port settlements in Japan.[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10">10</xref>] The first photographers who were enterprising enough to seek new business opportunities using this Western visual technology in the newly opened Japan were Westerners. Most of them were based in China and some had operated photography studios in Shanghai or in Hong Kong where photography had been practiced for seventeen years before Japan opened her Treaty Ports. This geographical proximity may explain their early appearance in Japan.</p>
      <p>Because during their first years these Japanese Treaty Ports were considered frontier towns (Yokohama had only forty foreign residents at the end of 1859, the first year of trade) it took some time before the first photographers established their commercial studios in these areas. Although some Western photographers had already visited Japan, the first significant wave of Western commercial photographers arrived around 1860.[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11">11</xref>] Pierre Joseph Rossier, a Swiss commercial photographer who was dispatched from his London agency, took the first commercial photographs of Japan as early as 1859. Orrin Erastus Freeman (1830–66), an American professional photographer who was based in Shanghai and possibly the first Western photographer to establish a permanent residence in Japan, opened a studio in Yokohama in 1860. William Saunders (1832–92, active in the early 1860s), a British photographer based in Shanghai, came to Japan in 1862 for several months to expand his portfolio with Japanese sights, especially of Edo and Yokohama. Saunders' British colleague, Charles Parker, shifted his base from Hong Kong to Yokohama in 1863, where he remained active until 1865. Felice Beato, a Corfu-born British photographer, who was to become one of the most prominent figures in the nineteenth-century souvenir photography industry in Japan, arrived in Yokohama around June 1863.[<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12">12</xref>] Shimooka Renjō, one of the earliest Japanese professional photographers, opened his first photography studio in Yokohama in 1862; by 1875 it had expanded to three branches in the city. At one of his branch shops on Yokohama's main avenue (Honcho Street), Renjō had a photography studio on the first floor while the ground floor was designated for the sale of souvenir articles, including one of the most popular souvenir articles for foreign visitors––nishikie woodblock prints. The items for sale in Renjō's shop illustrate several important aspects of the Yokohama port city culture: The growing importance of photography as a commercial enterprise, and even more significant, the association of photography businesses in Yokohama with the city's growing souvenir industry.</p>

      <title>The coming of the globetrotter</title>
      <p>The early customers for Japanese souvenir photographs of Yokohama were primarily foreign residents of the town. They were a diverse community of long-term dwellers that included missionaries, diplomats,[13] merchants, and members of Western military garrisons and naval squadrons who were assigned to Treaty Ports between 1863 and the mid-1870s in reaction to a series of violent attacks on their citizens by locals. The clientele profile of the Yokohama-based photography studios is evident from the advertisements in English-language local newspapers like Japan Weekly and Japan Herald, which targeted the expatriate communities in the Japanese Treaty Ports. The texts of these advertisements are explicit. William Saunders, for instance, announced his arrival to the "community of Yokohama" in an advertisement in Japan Herald (September 20, 1862), the earliest-known advertisement by a studio in Japan.[14] In 1870 the advertisement placed by Felice Beato in Japan Weekly announced his sale of photography albums and was also aimed at the local clientele:</p>
      <disp-quote>Signor F. Beato, begs to announce to the Public of Yokohama and Travellers visiting the East generally, that he has just completed a handsome collection of Albums of various sizes, containing views &c., of Japan, with descriptions of the Scenes, Manners and Customs of the people; compiled after visiting all the most interesting localities in the country during six years residence.
          NO.17 ON THE BUND[15]</disp-quote>
      <p>The reference to "(t)ravellers visiting the East" in this advertisement alerts us to  the fact that a new group of customers had made its appearance by the early 1870s, the "globetrotter."  His emergence greatly expanded the tourist market for the Yokohama photographic trade. Globetrotter travelling had been greatly facilitated in 1869 by the shortcut from Europe to Asia that had opened via the Suez Canal and across the United States through the completion of the Trans-American railway. The first scheduled trans-Pacific steamship service by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company traveling from San Francisco via Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagasaki to Hong Kong began in 1867. In 1874 the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company was launched by the Union Pacific and Central Railways to provide a service from the US East Coast to Asia. Furthermore, steamship development drastically shortened the travelling time from Europe and North America to East Asia, while also making travel more comfortable and convenient.</p>

    <p>By encouraging authors and publishers to use and evolve open software components and a lightweight exchange format usable by web-clients, we reduce the obstacles that originate from economic competition and pave the way to true open publishing and an open exchange of information.</p> 
  	<p>With Substance, we would like to contribute an extensive content creation and annotation framework built on web infrastructure. It is designed to be customized and integrated into existing workflows.</p>
    <p>We think that research in general could also benefit from such a set of tools. We are also collaborating with the team at <ext-link xlink:href="http://fiduswriter.org/">Fidus Writer</ext-link>, since our projects share many ideas.
