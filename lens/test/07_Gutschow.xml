      <title>How Celestial Spirits Became Winged in the Architecture of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal (Sixth to Nineteenth Century)</title>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>From at least the fifth century CE, distinct architectural styles developed in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Buddhist monasteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID0aa556d1-aacf-4d8c-b1c4-b82fffe031b6" rid="TO_LINK">Nep. <italic>b&#257;h&#299;</italic>/<italic>b&#257;h&#257;</italic>
            </xref>), votive structures (Skt. <italic>st&#363;pas</italic>/Nep. <italic>caityas</italic>), tiered temples (Nep. <italic>dega&#7717;</italic>), towering stone temples (Skt. <italic>&#347;ikhara</italic>), arcaded platforms (Skt. <italic>ma&#7751;&#7693;apa</italic>/Nep. <italic>phalc&#257;</italic>), and palaces characterised the squares and courtyards of a dense urban fabric. Structural and decorative details were borrowed from the Gangetic plains and the Tibetan plateau, and subsequently domesticated and transformed. The urban culture of the valley shared a common set of celestial spirits which dwelt in the atmosphere. These spirits guarded the celestial rain or may have represented the rain cloud itself. Wisdom bearers (Skt. <italic>vidy&#257;dhara</italic>) in particular, appeared flying, albeit without wings, as guardians of doors, windows, and thresholds for 1000 years. In the middle of the seventeenth century, to conform to established images of angel-like spirits (Pers. <italic>pari</italic>) of Mughal-Iranian provenance, they were equipped with wings and clad in outlandish dress, successfully replacing the earlier spirits.</p>

      <title>The urban culture of the Kathmandu Valley</title>
      <p>Very little is known about the early inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley (which has an area of approximately 1,000 square kilometres, and a minimum altitude of 1,250 to 1,360 metres) and settlement patterns prior to the present inhabitants, the Newars, who developed a distinct urban culture (<xref rid="ID37546336-2b29-4ead-9188-17a52d3f12b9" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb76561b1-8a10-45d8-8e50-4686462a68e7">Gutschow 1982</xref>) from at least the fifth century CE (to which the earliest known architectural fragments are dated). By the end of the first millennium, three cities had emerged: Bhaktapur (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID986c06f2-7f14-4984-8342-2f8d5007380f">Nev. Khvopa</xref>), Patan (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5ab81f60-e12b-4d87-83ec-19f4bcda46d1">Nev. Yala</xref>), and Kathmandu (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID48a9d12a-1c1a-4659-8c9b-4f71faf04d10">Nev. Ye</xref>), as well as a couple of smaller towns and some eleven villages in a compact settlement style, with three-storeyed houses lining narrow lanes and courtyards, creating an essentially urban character (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4d2ab726-c2b5-41a9-866c-e69cc8ce7843">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>[Fig. 1 here]</p>
      <p>The origin of the Newars remains obscure, so we know little about the background from which their specific urban lifestyle and clustered settlement pattern developed. The structure of their language points to Tibeto-Burman origin, but because they settled in the valley, the language was highly exposed to the Great Tradition of the Gangetic plains, with its dominant Brahmanic culture.</p>
      <p>A specific townscape dotted with imposing temples dedicated to the personal gods and goddesses of the kings and many hypaethral shrines housing the aniconic Lords of Place&#8212;preferably identified as Ga&#7751;e&#347;a or Bhairava&#8212;produced an intense dialogue and often a discrepancy between narrow private courtyards and spacious public squares that served (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID470d1336-6837-4d37-b2f9-bb3a25fa5626">and still serve</xref>) as a stage for enacting urban rituals.</p>

      <title>Notes about transcultural flows</title>
      <p>From at least the fifth century on, Newar architecture encountered, accepted, and appropriated a large variety of motifs and structural elements from the North and the South, based on a general willingness throughout history to accept innovations from other cultural spheres in a dynamic development process.</p>
      <p>The urban culture of the Kathmandu Valley has not only been a recipient of transcultural influence: viewed from a transcultural perspective, it occupies a space of transition. It borrowed from, and transmitted to, what it both connects and separates&#8212;the Gangetic plains and the Tibetan plateau. Its geographical remoteness, which allowed Buddhism to flourish without interruption, never led to cultural isolation. The continuity of the geographically confined, and at times competing, kingdoms of the valley has always served as a multidirectional and multivalent treasure house of ideas, forms, specialised skills, and knowledge.</p>
      <p>Almost every structural or decorative detail of Newar architecture is made up of elements that travelled a long way to be transformed into a particular shape, which, through a long process, became unmistakably identifiable as &#8220;Newar.&#8221; Harking back to a common set of symbols of almost universally valid cosmological and cosmogonic associations, such details are based on ideas centring around the mountain as the vertical axis, water and rain, sun and moon.</p>
      <p>The following presentation illustrates how celestial creatures&#8212;generally associated with water&#8212;inhabited and still inhabit a vast transcultural space, in which myths travelled in all directions. Common to all myths are hybrid creatures associated with water, and which combine various bodily features to create ambiguity. The hybrid creatures which inhabit the woodwork, brickwork, and stone of the architecture of the Kathmandu Valley, unveil the cultural entanglement of the Newars.</p>
      <p>Influence, emergence, derivation, transformation, amalgamation, impregnation or assimilation&#8212;all these terms attempt to describe the process of transcultural activity, in this case with respect to architectural details and iconographical programmes. This activity or &#8220;flow&#8221; often transcends encounters between neighbouring regions, with their varying architectural traditions. With reference to the concept of transculturality, architecture is not seen as being produced in a static environment, but being embedded in a dynamic and never-ending process of change. The craftsman is never an isolated actor in a well-defined territory, but one embedded in a zone of contact with fluent, flexible borders.</p>
      <p>To speak of an &#8220;influence&#8221; would &#8220;deprive both ends of a cultural production, the passing and the receiving entity, of their autonomy,&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e105"/> as art historian Hans Belting maintains. Cultural production is indeed a never-ending process: under certain conditions&#8212;whether landscape, natural resources, or religion&#8212;the grammar of an architectural vernacular is constantly extended. The vocabulary of symbols and motifs that roved&#8212;and is still roving&#8212;throughout Central and Southern Asia tended to be incorporated or assimilated via a complex process of newly emerging forms.</p>

        <title>Genii of Roman and Sasanian provenance</title>
        <p>The pictorial formation of <italic>genii</italic> facing each other in a triumphal arch became a permanent feature in the Roman Empire. Originally, winged male <italic>genii</italic> symbolised fertility and bestowed power. In a Roman context, they carried trophies in their hands to celebrate victory. Beginning in the late fourth century, these <italic>genii</italic> became angels in a Christian context, but were still depicted facing one another. The Roman theme of two figures being depicted face to face reappears at the T&#257;q-e Bost&#257;n cave reliefs, created under the Sasanian king Xusr&#333; II (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8a36eef5-41b3-4261-bbbe-4236472fbe69">590&#8211;628 CE</xref>). These figures are discussed in this volume by Shervin Farridnejad, in his investigation of the iconography of Zoroastrian angelology.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e134"/> Depicted with wings and fluttering ribbons, they carry wreathes of sovereignty and bowls with pearls in their hands, as a sign of investiture and wealth. From here, similar types of winged <italic>genii</italic> can be traced along the Silk Road, leaving evidence at B&#257;miy&#257;n, in Afghanistan, and in Turfan. &#8220;In such a way Roman and Byzantine trends, having assumed a Sasanid structural form, are still further conveyed into the East,&#8221; in what Ingeborg Luschey-Schmeisser observed as a never-ending act of &#8220;giving and taking one from the other&#8221; (<xref rid="IDb5bc9f75-35b7-439f-9970-60a2ffc5f14a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID868ffa0a-c13f-4427-978e-c50d56c7e576">Luschey-Schmeisser 1978, 50</xref>). This is exactly what can be understood as a process of transcultural exchange, a notion that transcends the narrow concept of &#8220;influence.&#8221;</p>
        <p>The persistent reappearance of auspicious motifs that ensure prosperity and pay homage to an emperor testifies to a valid symbolic association with winged airborne spirits. Framing a spiritual leader such as the Buddha, these spirits also reached India and, finally, in the sixth century, Nepal.</p>

        <title>The background of aerial spirits&#8212;Gupta-period origins</title>
        <p>Beneficent aerial spirits populated stone reliefs within the context of early Buddhist monuments of the ancient Gupta Empire, such as those from Bh&#257;rhut, S&#257;&#241;c&#299; and Amar&#257;vat&#299;. As &#8220;bearers of wisdom&#8221; (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID53f99c42-5ca1-4f7a-80b7-84b4fc3df6d1">vidy&#257;dhara</xref></italic>), they appeared either in human or hybrid form, with the upper half of the body in human form, the lower half bird-like. On the first century northern tympanum of the Great St&#363;pa of S&#257;&#241;c&#299;, such bird men can be seen equipped with long wings, carrying garlands, and turning to the object of veneration, a <italic>st&#363;pa</italic>. A century later, such spirits were depicted airborne, flanking the top of Buddha images, their outer leg almost straight and the knee of their inner leg reaching the height of the navel (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb0814f7f-2b8f-4018-ab9b-4e539e665ba0">Huntington 1985, 99 and 153</xref>). On similar and contemporary reliefs of the S&#257;tav&#257;hana dynasty at Nasik, flying garland bearers appear with both legs bent at the knees. On fifth-century Gupta period panels, the wisdom bearers carry auspicious offerings in cups, their lower leg bent in such a way that it appears parallel to the body. Fluttering shawls entwine their bodies. This position of the body remained unchanged for almost a millennium.</p>
        <p>The terminology of the aerial spirits, who roam the rain-bearing clouds, appears somewhat confusing. Wisdom bearers are depicted airborne and carry, as Margaret and James Stutley explain, &#8220;flower-garlands symbolizing victory, and sometimes swords representing the wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDfcf817c1-a87c-478f-a7cc-fb265d451618" rid="TO_LINK"><italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID087d2cd6-b4b5-4e10-99a6-ab030f75eb2e">vidy&#257;</xref></italic></xref>) that cuts through ignorance <italic>(a-<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID39c0af6f-dcf5-448e-bae0-d5681144a4d2">vidy&#257;</xref>
               </italic>)&#8221; (Stutley 1986, 332). Bird men (<italic>gandharvas</italic>) are the guardians of rain and may represent the rain clouds. As mentioned above, the upper halves of their bodies are depicted as human, the lower halves are bird-like. Along with the dancers of the gods (<italic>apsaras</italic>) and other spirits with human heads and the bodies of horses, or with human bodies and the heads of horses (<italic>kinnaras</italic>), they &#8220;form the celestial choir in Kubera&#8217;s paradise&#8221; (Stutley 1986, 332). Kubera, being the leader of mysterious <italic>genii</italic>, is associated with generative power. Bird men are also considered to be celestial musicians, depicted with string instruments or cymbals. Wings are not always seen attached to their bird bodies, and they rarely appear in mid-air. The identity of all these <italic>genii </italic>is often veiled, the wisdom bearers being depicted with musical instruments and the bird men holding garlands. The freedom inherent to woodcarving includes the possibility of producing ever more hybrid creatures which evade the clear-cut definitions historians of iconography tend to create.</p>

        <title>The arrival of Gupta-period wisdom-bearers and bird men in Nepal</title>
        <p>For a convincing prototype of the Gupta-period wisdom bearers that made their early entry into Nepal, we shall look at a fifth century fragment in terracotta, from Uttar Pradesh, India (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID75ab7ecf-a23e-4e84-91f9-0fe03028b8a3">Fig. 2</xref>), which depicts an aerial spirit holding a garland of braided flowers. In the sixth or early seventh century, similar flying spirits first appeared in Nepal on two panels in low relief, fixed to the drum of a large <italic>caitya</italic> at Tuk&#227;b&#257;h&#257; in Kathmandu (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe7ec1b47-34b4-4db0-a4e3-1192429f341f">Fig. 3</xref>). On these panels, the wisdom bearers fly almost horizontally, their legs bent to an extreme, and hold offerings in their raised hands.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 2 here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 3 here]</p>
        <p>Pairs of lions, geese, snake virgins, composite creatures such as winged and horned lions, and hybrid forms of bird men are seen guarding the niches of hundreds of <italic>caityas </italic>of the Licchavi period (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID731022c6-f164-463f-89c6-390627db199c">sixth to eighth century Nepal</xref>).</p>
        <p>However, flying human figures depicted without wings (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID71bb441d-c394-4b3f-a1ee-c0a056c521c0">vidy&#257;dhara</xref></italic>) and mirroring Gupta-period prototypes are quite rare. These airborne, wingless, human-bodied <italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc81ccfb1-b768-4c8f-a658-b4cc6ce384fd">vidy&#257;dhara</xref></italic> survive solely on a few fragments in stone, on lintels, and on the supporting blocks below aedicules&#8212;with or without small openings, all of them dated from the ninth to thirteenth centuries. One of these, salvaged from an esoteric shrine at Sulima Square, in Patan, has been carbon dated to the late tenth century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e217"/> Similar bearers of wisdom, invariably with large earrings, a turban-like hairstyle, and a diadem above the forehead, quite literally bear the architectural frame of aedicules or miniature windows. An example can be seen in a Buddhist context at the <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc8bc4e48-4252-4468-bfc3-601930bc7d93">Sasunani</xref> and Ukub&#257;h&#257; monasteries, both in Patan (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID23526018-2074-4625-a389-8231b7e928df">dated ninth century</xref>), and in Itumb&#257;h&#257; and Yethk&#257;b&#257;h&#257;, two monastic courtyards in Kathmandu (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID64d20baa-05f8-4550-a4ad-78229b4465ee">both tenth century</xref>). In these cases, the original structure of the buildings has been replaced on more than one occasion. Earlier carved elements such as struts (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID87692192-8c62-4cb6-9417-06485cee40e9">Ukub&#257;h&#257;, Itumb&#257;h&#257;</xref>), aedicules (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID605d302e-3856-413e-9493-4a8debbc870a">Sasunani, Ukub&#257;h&#257;</xref>), and doors (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID84168a0e-f800-4c87-b01d-631b4e04741f">Sasunani</xref>) were regularly integrated into the new buildings, which were re-erected on the same foundations.</p>
        <p>Bird men (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbd6e298d-32af-4d67-9484-a045390f7f65">gandharvas</xref></italic>)&#8212;hybrid, half human, half bird creatures&#8212;appeared contemporaneously with the wisdom bearers of Tuk&#227;b&#257;h&#257; on five Licchavicaityas&#8212;<italic>caityas</italic> dating back to the reign of Licchavi kings&#8212;at Cabahil (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf1c75bcb-3fb9-4d9d-9977-bad3d2e4fd51">Gutschow 1997, 161, 162, 166, 167, and 170</xref>). On these miniature votive structures, hybrid creatures frame the niches that were once sheltering images of the Tath&#257;gatas, at the bottom ends of what may be called the jambs and, in one case, the panels on either side of the niche. In contrast to the wisdom bearers of Gupta provenance, the bird men on these <italic>caityas</italic> are never placed above the object of worship, but always below it.</p>
        <p>Bird men were rarely depicted flying, and their wings were never outspread, but remained an almost inseparable part of their feathered bodies. Their tails would have triggered associations with water, because they were depicted like lotus foliage growing upwards, in coils, to support a leonine, mask-like head (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDed89eca1-14ef-4f01-b7a2-c87a37650617" rid="TO_LINK">Skt. <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic>
               </xref>) crowning the niche frame. Other hybrid creatures, such as the water-borne <italic>makara</italic>, or the gander (Skt. <italic>ha&#7745;sa</italic>), often appeared in the place of bird men, framing niches on Licchavicaityas. While the <italic>makara</italic> is an aquatic animal inspired by the crocodile, the gander symbolises cosmic breath, its exhalation referred to as <italic>ham</italic> and its inhalation <italic>sa</italic>. The tails of both creatures develop into the cloud foliage characteristic of bird men.</p>

        <title>Wisdom bearers and bird men on portals and lintels, eleventh to sixteenth century</title>
        <p>The earliest known pair of female and male wisdom bearers (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID44576e9d-7363-48a3-946d-f5cca985d7ee">vidy&#257;dhara/vidy&#257;dhar&#299;</xref>)</italic> in the Kathmandu Valley appear on the lintels of the Ma&#241;ju&#347;r&#299; Temple of Sasunani, and the principal doorway to the courtyard of Ukub&#257;h&#257; in Patan and, based on radiocarbon testing, are datable to the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, respectively. The pairs at Ukub&#257;h&#257; are partly hidden behind eighteenth-century colonnettes, which were later added to support a tympanum to beautify the existing building. These pairs of wisdom bearers demonstrate a supreme mastery of craftsmanship; the details seem to hark back to the Gajendramok&#7779;a relief of the early sixth-century Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Temple, in Deogarh (<xref rid="IDa40b5d36-6a54-4498-b496-1f2c352e6b23" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa27de580-1339-43f5-9abe-e4ffce62be46">Huntington 1985, 211</xref>). At Ukub&#257;h&#257;, a much smaller female <italic>vidhy&#257;dar&#299; </italic>rests at ease on the thighs of her larger male partner; both have stretched legs. Depicted carrying garlands or bowls filled with jewels or fruit, wisdom bearers appear on lintels in both a Buddhist (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID26353f16-8433-4589-9657-196469c24b9f">Yetkh&#257;b&#257;h&#257;</xref>), and Hindu context (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1cedc102-b2ad-49ea-bd1a-a74b6fb839b5">Vi&#347;ve&#347;vara Temple in Panauti</xref>; <xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9f1d3a91-a091-4c4d-b034-118bda167a3b">Ratne&#347;vara Temple in Patan</xref>) and have been dated to the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. At Ukub&#257;h&#257; and Yethk&#257;b&#257;h&#257;, the male <italic>vidy&#257;dhara</italic> appears with his female counterpart, <italic>vidy&#257;dhar&#299;</italic>, in a loving pose.</p>
        <p>Similar pairs of wisdom bearers which survive in their original structural configuration can be found on the lintels of the western portal of the Indre&#347;vara Temple, in Panauti. The temple was first constructed before the middle of the thirteenth century (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0b082bb0-817d-45be-9dc8-7124d7927ecd">radiocarbon tested 1121&#8211;1229</xref>), though an often quoted document suggests its consecration in 1294 (<xref rid="ID60cb0881-03ce-421d-b763-f57229095f86" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7e248b4a-d1e6-4326-867d-3a3c6843d256">Slusser 1982, 165</xref>). Wisdom bearers also support the eight aedicules which house representations of the guardians of the eight directions (Skt. <italic>dikp&#257;las</italic>).

        <p>The moment music and dancing are added to a scene, associations with another class of aerial spirits, the <italic>gandharvas</italic>, are triggered. <italic>Gandharvas</italic> populate Indra&#8217;s paradise and are mostly represented in hybrid form, half human and half bird, and were thus introduced earlier as bird men.</p>
        <p>In such a form, following the prototypes on Licchavicaityas,<italic> gandharvas</italic> were first depicted  on the eleventh-century, carved wooden panels flanking the doorway of the shrine at Bungabah&#299;, in Bungamati; on the lintel of a five-part window at Itumb&#257;h&#257;; and on the fragmentary tympanum of the triple window at Jangamma&#7789;h (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDac91f166-1b50-4521-a34b-1c48200fc752">twelfth century</xref>), in Bhaktapur. Large and exceptionally deep in relief, and adorned with flamboyant details, <italic>ghandarvas</italic> reappeared in 1586, on lintels and the lower ends of wall brackets in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Temple, in Bhaktapur, which stands out for its unrivalled artistic carvings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID97223ead-a009-4fc9-aa3b-b839ada0b056">Gutschow 2011, 425 and 1001</xref>).</p>
        <p><italic>Vidy&#257;dhara</italic> without wings dominate the supporting blocks of aedicules and have been depicted with four hands filled with offerings, a sword, and a shield (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1e4568fc-3a4d-4da6-aa10-4b78b38ab133">C&#257;r N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a in Patan, 1567</xref>) or facing forward (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID20765989-9801-4344-8175-209664e9b7d0">C&#257;r N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a in Kathmandu, 1563</xref>).

Common to them all are coils of lotus foliage, which Gautam Vajracharya aptly termed &#8220;cloud foliage&#8221; (<xref rid="ID856904fe-5d7e-46da-9c69-68236da83672" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5a435b20-8b26-4b57-a598-946a61f1816c">Vajracharya 2009, 12</xref>).</p>
        <p>In one instance, at Itumb&#257;h&#257; in Kathmandu, wisdom-bearers (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID444fa309-4b2a-4f88-ba8c-c64904fb0ab9">Fig. 5</xref>) appear on the base of a sixteenth-century <italic>st&#363;pa</italic> with four standing Tath&#257;gatas (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9c810bc5-7049-400d-a4a2-0ce1ae8f04c5">Gutschow 1997, 47, 176 and 177 and Gutschow 2011, 680</xref>). This rare design replicates sixth-century prototypes and, in turn, represents a prototype for six similar <italic>st&#363;pas </italic>of the late seventeenth century. While the guardians of the universe (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7574848f-228d-4e8c-8c7b-a00be3fb9a12">dikp&#257;la</xref></italic>) support large lotus flowers, which in turn support the Tath&#257;gatas, the wisdom bearers frame the guardians. The wisdom bearers obviously underwent a fundamental change of location. For almost 1500 years, they framed the Buddha, the doors leading to a monastic courtyard, or the shrine of a monastery, heralding the victory of the teachings of the Buddha (Skt. <italic>dharma</italic>). This sixteenth century example places them at the very bottom of a composition, below the Buddha, not among cloud-like foliage, but&#8212;still in flight, yet wingless&#8212;supported by fully-opened lotus flowers.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 5 here]</p>
        <p>Airborne wisdom bearers dominate ten of the twenty base stones filling the gaps between the pillars of the ambulatory of the Vi&#347;ve&#347;vara temple in Patan, established in 1627. They have either two or four hands, hold garlands of offerings, wield swords (representing the wisdom, <italic>vidy&#257;</italic>, that cuts through ignorance) and shields, or play stringed instruments. In a few cases, the wisdom bearers are replaced by bird men, <italic>gandharva</italic>s, playing stringed instruments. In contrast to this rich representation of celestial spirits, neither <italic>vidy&#257;dharas</italic> nor scenes from the epics are presented on lintels, the location where they were often found until the end of the sixteenth century.</p>
        <p>The Vi&#347;ve&#347;vara Temple departs from this convention and introduces, probably for the first time, the eight planetary deities (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDf746af1d-3d1c-4a26-9159-e01f229ab00a" rid="TO_LINK"><italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdaa1fb20-eb79-467a-8b30-2c96bd452d1d">Navagraha</xref></italic></xref>). Like so many iconographical details, the depiction of the planetary deities reaches back to the Gupta period, as reflected in their widespread, apotropaic use on lintels. In the context of Newar temples, this scheme was changed in such a way that two planets guarded each of the four doors of a temple based on a square plan. In other spatial configurations that did not allow for the appearance of the eight deities, the scheme was subsequently reduced to the pair of sun (Skt. <italic>S&#363;rya</italic>) and moon (Skt. <italic>Candra</italic>) which, for the coming three centuries, dominated the lintels of doors.</p>
        <p>Wisdom bearers of Gupta-period provenance rarely appeared on lintels after the end of the seventeenth century. One example can be seen in the early eighteenth-century principal courtyard (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDaeb5e5b4-305e-4a08-8b88-d676e2af612f">M&#363;cuka</xref>) of the Patan palace. There, the wisdom bearer&#8217;s upper body is not presented in an upright position, but bent forwards, possibly to emphasise the act of flying. A few more representations are found on the lintels of the secondary doors facing the square, enclosed in circular lotus tendrils, or on door jambs.</p>
        <p>Flying aerial spirits, with or without wings, have long been used in Nepal to either frame a door or triple portal, or to support an aedicule, with or without an opening. In the sixteenth century, they were replaced by the narrative depiction of mythic events, and in the early seventeenth century, by the planetary deities, preferably the pair of sun and moon, or even by dragons. Finally, in the second half of the seventeenth century, airborne spirits with winged bodies, floating garments and eccentric headgear suddenly began to appear on temples and palaces in Nepal. At about the same time, such angel-like hybrid beings began to populate paintings<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e372"/>, as the contribution by Katharina Weiler to this volume demonstrates.</p>
        <p>Dragons and wisdom bearers, now equipped with wings, seem to be the soaring winners in a contest to occupy strategic spaces in the iconographic programme of a door or window. These two creatures supersede the original Gupta-period heritage in their participation in new transcultural moves. The incorporation of the Chinese Mughal dragon and the Persian Mughal angel into the architectural decoration of temples and palaces demonstrates the need to associate the late Malla kingdoms with the Mughals before angels of Christian provenance took over at the end of the nineteenth century, as also discussed by Katharina Weiler. The following overview of various sources should be seen as a short sketch.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e390"/>

        <title>Angels (pari) or genii of Persian provenance</title>
        <p>The Persian type of Solomonic angel first appeared on the outer west wall of the Lahore Fort (<xref rid="IDd037928a-d6fa-43dd-9a66-2eedd5729005" ref-type="bibr" id="ID61217059-94aa-4bfa-8169-52c55a4ff768">Koch 2001, 31</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e411"/> in the 1620s, probably a decade later than the wall paintings of Kala Burj. Myths and legends referring to the Qur&#8217;anic figure Solomon present him as the prophet king who has command over the demons (Pers. <italic>jinns</italic>), which he controls with the assistance of winged spirits (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe5121c3d-1b04-4bcb-938a-1d3a2bb774c1">pari</xref></italic>). These winged spirits are often depicted with long, floating garments, carrying fruit bowls, or playing musical instruments.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e428"/> In Persian paintings, the legs of these spirits are always concealed by long garments. At the wall of the Lahore Fort, however, we see for a pair of feet emerging from a long skirt the first time (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf2c05bc5-a9e3-47d9-8aa2-2a843ded54ec">see the contribution by Ebba Koch</xref>).</p>
        <p>The bent legs and fluttering scarves of the angels at the Lahore Fort reveal a pre-Islamic tradition and establish a link to both Gupta provenance, and the wingless wisdom bearers of Ku&#7779;&#257;&#7751;a, as described by Chari Pradel in this volume. However, the crown-like cap, wings with three registers of feathers, and trousers which conceal the legs and often even the feet are representative of the later Persian-Islamic tradition which stands for &#8220;victory and power of the sovereign from the earlier tradition, blessing and happiness from the later tradition&#8221; (<xref rid="IDb5bc9f75-35b7-439f-9970-60a2ffc5f14a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5a2a79df-c543-4192-acf7-b9539c2ae011">Luschey-Schmeisser 1978, 53</xref>). Also noteworthy is the appearance of two- and three-pronged clouds, which had already &#8220;travelled&#8221; with Chinese artists to the court of the Il Khans at Tabriz, in the thirteenth century (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb1872c52-3e76-45c8-953e-a63240e90b0e">see also Koch Fig. 5 in this volume</xref>).</p>
        <p>It is exactly this type of flying spirit with a long garment and eccentric headgear that has populated capitals, tympana, and door frames of Newar architecture since the middle of the seventeenth century. Pronged cloud motifs effectively replaced the cloud foliage shaped like coils of lotus leaves, which had dominated wood and stone carvings for a millennium.</p>

        <title>Christian angels at Mughal courts</title>
        <p>European-style angels in Mughal wall paintings arrived in the first decade of the seventeenth century, as Ebba Koch documents in her contribution to this volume.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e446"/> Iranian-style angels and boyish, (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4a850210-ef8b-40e2-8093-be20e96134d6">half</xref>) nude <italic>putti</italic> following European prototypes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e457"/>, both equipped with feathered wings, can be seen at the Lahore Fort. Of these, some characteristics of the Iranian angel type found their way to Nepal in the course of the early seventeenth century. Such angel types gained popularity in the eighteenth century and populated wood carvings until the early twentieth century, before angels in stucco took over, moulded after British, or Anglo-Indian prototypes in colonial India.</p>
        <p>The Kala Burj, a pavilion integrated into the north wall of the fort in Lahore during the first decade of the seventeenth century, was &#8220;populated by winged beings of the celestial regions.&#8221; These paintings add, as Koch observes, to the notion of the architecture &#8220;as a heavenly vault of concentric spheres demarcated by stars&#8221; (<xref rid="IDd037928a-d6fa-43dd-9a66-2eedd5729005" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdb1c77b8-2e85-45e3-a3de-3573ea5220b8">Koch 2001, 20</xref>). The stars contain flying birds, the central medallion showing two fighting mythical birds (Pers. <italic>simurgh</italic>) taken from a Persian context. The angels of the wall painting are &#8220;characteristic products of the creative dialogue between Mughal and European art in the time of Jahangir&#8221; (<xref rid="IDd037928a-d6fa-43dd-9a66-2eedd5729005" ref-type="bibr" id="ID979c3d9f-7635-4f58-a394-bbf04ce07c76">Koch 2001, 21</xref>).</p>
        <p>The legs of the painted angels are bent backwards at the knees, in a fashion that can be seen in late-sixteenth century European prototypes. At the same time, they recall the bent legs of the wisdom bearers (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8d69d040-96d6-4213-bc7e-1dce4a3220f3">vidy&#257;dhara</xref></italic>) which have appeared flanking the Buddha since the early Ku&#7779;&#257;&#7751;a period (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID550c6ab5-071b-49da-b918-33e896a784e2">first to second century</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the Islamic context of a Mughal palace, winged beings and birds were traditional motifs that symbolised victory and power. In a specific Persian context, such motifs were clearly used &#8220;in search for the blessing of the angels and as winged beings which protect and serve the ruler.&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e479"/> Jahangir realised the heavenly palace in the architectural form of the Kala Burj.</p>

Such coiled foliage should be understood as framing the gates of the celestial dome. These gates were considered &#8220;the source of rainwater,&#8221; as Gautam Vajracharya writes (<xref rid="ID856904fe-5d7e-46da-9c69-68236da83672" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa062c277-ef2c-478b-868b-a1975e634483">Vajracharya 2003, 53</xref>). The entire tradition based on water symbolism was gradually abandoned and replaced with other formal sets of meaning. Since the early seventeenth century, lintels were either occupied by the Buddhist eight auspicious objects, by lotus flowers, or vines with a rather non-descript cloud foliage. Amidst such a fundamental change in iconographical modalities, winged spirits with long garments and new headgear replaced the wisdom bearers, and the bird men began to appear with outspread wings.</p>
        <p rend="ref">Through their transformation into hybrid beings with wings, the wisdom bearer in human form and the hybrid bird men seem to have merged. Both are believed to populate celestial realms and promise rain.

        <title>The emergence of winged wisdom bearers&#8212;seventeenth century</title>
        <p>The emergence of winged spirits in Mughal garb in Nepal represents yet another stage of the assimilation of airborne spirits. To mark their Islamic origin, I suggest designating the emerging figures as &#8220;angelic spirits.&#8221;</p>
        <p>The first angel spirit of the new type appears on a tympanum at the Tusahiti (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDca6d7d0f-7e56-4169-91ce-b5daf5f81f00">Fig. 6</xref>), in the stairwell of the Sundaricuka quadrangle at the southern end of Patan&#8217;s palace complex. Attributed to King Siddhinarasi&#7745;hamalla, the stairwell has been dated by many authors to 1647, although this dating is derived from much later sources (<xref rid="ID0d258b2f-f31e-4fcb-b018-ab8c4c4b1251" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5b2fb44f-9644-4d10-b7f7-9f1e6cc4be5e">B&#252;hnemann 2008, 92</xref>). A pair of flying spirits holding a yak-tail whisk in one hand and a flower offering in the other, frame a garland that forms a triangle above the tympanum. The garland hangs from the top of a pinnacle that crowns the tympanum behind the golden spout of the water conduit.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 6 here]</p>
        <p>At first glance, the figures at the stairwell look like variations of those attendants who frame various deities or the Buddha while wielding similar whisks as an insignia of royalty. However, none of these early representations of spirits have wings. The newer, &#8220;foreign,&#8221; and more &#8220;modern&#8221; of the figures at the stairwell is identifiable by the combination of its footwear and what appears to be a bobble cap. These figures seem to hang in mid-air, while not really flying. Only upon close inspection can the wings be distinguished. They are not fixed to the arms, but emerge from behind the body.</p>
        <p>Throughout the seventeenth century, wings were obviously not considered mandatory for the presentation of garland bearers in their new form as angelic spirits of Mughal origin. Thus such a pair of airborne spirits without wings is integrated into the carvings on the lintel of the shrine of Nagub&#257;h&#257; (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe82b302c-5b48-463d-92d2-b5c4b9e163ef">Figs. 7a and 7b</xref>), a small monastic courtyard located in the Southeast of Patan, which was consecrated in 1673. Not occupying the broad part of the extended lintel, but placed beside the planetary guardians, the sun and the moon, they seem to represent an additional layer on top of an already existing iconographical order. With their hands raised to hold a garland of flowers, their upper bodies follow the order of the ancient wisdom bearers, complete with diadems, large earrings, necklaces, and floating scarves. The lower halves of their bodies, however, follow a new convention based on Mughal and Iranian prototypes: they are bent backwards horizontally, and clad in long skirts from which their bare feet emerge. This posture suggests flying, although no traces of clouds, which by that time had become fashionable, can be seen.      </p>
        <p>[Fig. 7a here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 7b here]</p>
        <p>Almost contemporary to the wingless airborne spirit of Nagub&#257;h&#257; are those winged, angel-like spirits on the Siddhilak&#7779;m&#299; Temple (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7811e35b-0bde-42b5-9526-e44ca23f3f59">Fig. 8</xref>), in Bhaktapur&#8217;s Darb&#257;r Square. Dedicated to his lineage deity, King Jit&#257;mitramalla established this temple in the 1680s. The iconography of the temple is dominated by the Mother Goddesses and Durg&#257;, in her form as the slayer of the buffalo demon. Almost identical to the prototype of the Tusahiti, the angels with their long garments, long hair, and outlandish caps occupy the projecting part of the capitals of those pillars which frame a narrow, south-facing porch. Their raised hands hold a garland of flowers in an almost perfect semicircle, in much the same way as the earlier wisdom bearers.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 8 here]</p>
        <p>A similar figure, yet without wings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID33364913-6d16-4940-b22a-b17af98fbf26">Fig. 9</xref>), appears on the principal entrance to Sundaricuka, the southern courtyard of Patan&#8217;s Palace, in which the abovementioned Tusahiti stairwell is located. The quadrangle, along with its doorway, was probably remodelled in the 1730s. Equipped with a bobble cap and shoes like its predecessor, the garland bearer wears a long-sleeved jacket and trousers in the Mughal fashion. The figure is depicted similarly to the wisdom bearers of the thirteenth to sixteenth century, with one leg bent and the other leg outstretched.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 9 here]</p>
        <p>The first truly winged spirits (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfaf7db67-9ec7-4710-87a4-5ea59e2943a2">Fig. 12a</xref>) of the new fashion are presented through a pair of angel-like figures framing the King of Serpents (Skt. <italic>n&#257;gar&#257;ja</italic>), who is depicted above the spout of a drinking water fountain (Nev. <italic>ja&#7717;dhu</italic>) in Taum&#257;dhi Square, in Bhaktapur, presumably installed by King Bh&#363;pat&#299;ndramalla in the early years of the eighteenth century. The earlier vest has now become a closed, short-sleeved jacket, covered in flower or cloud motifs. The inner leg is resolutely bent while the outer leg remains unseen behind clouds of hitherto unseen design. The three prongs of the cloud, the ribbed surface of which is reminiscent of water, form large triangles originating from a leaf-shaped curl at the centre, which can be loosely associated with the coils of lotus foliage, which have also been identified as cloud foliage, to evoke associations with rain. In her contribution to this volume, Chari Pradel mentions a similar pattern that may symbolise cloud energy, found on a fifth-century moulded brick from Dengxian, Henan Province, in China. The three-pronged cloud motif is one of those prominent motifs that made its way from China to Persia, through the Mughal courts of Lahore and Agra, to the valley of Kathmandu (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdd0a5c5e-918f-42c1-b99e-7d152e1ab358">see also Katharina Weiler&#8217;s article in this volume</xref>). The outstretched arms of the garland bearer hold a yak-tail whisk and a vase of plenty (Skt. <italic>kala&#347;a</italic>), from which no foliage emerges, as a pervasive symbol of fertility and affluence. However, a cloud motif touches the vase as if emerging from it.</p>

        <title>The dominance of winged spirits (vidy&#257;dhara, gandharvas and k&#299;rtimukha) in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries</title>
        <p>From the early eighteenth century, wisdom bearers (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDeec33e4a-9917-47c6-8959-399f6bfdccdb">vidy&#257;dhara</xref></italic>) with wings almost exclusively occupied the spandrels of the semi-circular or cusped arches of windows and doors. The pair of spirits presented on the first floor bay window of the courtyard of a Hindu monastic institution, the Kuthuma&#7789;h (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe521d3dc-b94d-4fd7-b160-5c61bb8aa6b9">Fig. 10</xref>) in Bhaktapur, dates to 1749 and may serve as a representative example. Walking on clouds rather than flying, the spirits areclad in attire similar to that depicted a hundred years earlier. Their outstretched arms hold garlands and seem to be attached to feathered wings. The motifs of fluttering scarves worn around the neck and the gesture of holding flower garlands seem to have been borrowed from the ancient wisdom bearers. The cloud motif faithfully follows seventeenth century examples and can no longer be mistaken for lotus foliage.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 10 here]</p>
        <p>Probably contemporary to the carvings at Kuthuma&#7789;h, the pairs of winged celestial musicians on the capitals of the arcade of the god house of Cv&#227;ga Ga&#7751;e&#347;a in Bhaktapur (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa2db26a6-44ed-4531-b65b-881455cddf25">Fig. 11</xref>) present a playful variation of the theme. Two full-length capitals and six half capitals provide space for ten figures flying horizontally among clouds. Holding a garland of flowers, carrying offerings, or playing musical instruments, they face a <italic>&#347;ivali&#7749;ga </italic>bedecked with garlands. The relief carving is unique in that the headgear and, in some cases, the feet transcend the inner frame of the capital. The wings emerge from behind the shoulders and turn upwards, while the arms are engaged in playing music or holding offerings.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 11 here]</p>
        <p>The wings of bird men (<italic><xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd0cd6653-c0cc-4315-becb-d40d32b2d48e">gandharvas</xref></italic>), which populated the spandrels of door and window openings till the early seventeenth century, were depicted as almost inseparable from their feathery bodies, while their tails developed into cloud foliage. In the early eighteenth century, the impulse to add outspread wings to spirits and even demons reached semi-divine beings other than wisdom bearers, such as bird men and even the demon mask <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID633b4a3f-59da-44bd-a1c0-679db5599958">literally &#8220;the face of glory&#8221;</xref>). However, bird men and <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> with outspread wings remained a rare innovation in Newar architecture.</p>
        <p>A good example of a bird man with outspread wings is found on the early eighteenth-century drinking water fountain in Taum&#257;dhi Square, in Bhaktapur, which also features a pair of winged wisdom bearers (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3d86c224-8674-4bc0-8bd3-ef3937341899">Fig. 12a</xref>). The bird man (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf9001226-51b3-45a8-a1b2-3db0a0ef8555">Fig. 12b</xref>) has a scaly upper body with a frilled collar and short, frilled sleeves. The wings emerge from behind the shoulders and have twelve registers of feathers. The talons look like those of a predatory bird. The feathery part of the bird half of the body starts below the waist and ends with eight long feathers. In sharp contrast to all its predecessors, the tail bears no resemblance whatsoever to cloud foliage. Associations with water are exclusively indicated by its scales, which are particular to serpents and dragons. Moreover, the objects they hold invite an association with Kuber, originally an earth spirit, who represents affluence, and thus seem to complement the bird man&#8217;s capacity to ensure rain. To comply with the contemporary fashion, the bird man wears a bobble hat with pearls on the rim.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 12a here]</p>
        <p>[Fig. 12b here]</p>
        <p>A <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> is invariably depicted as a mask-like face with upright ears, often with horns, a moustache, and fangs. Originally portrayed as a lion&#8217;s head (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDae02dbb6-a45f-4ad2-9897-7c0c6422268a" rid="TO_LINK">Skt. <italic>si&#7745;hamukha</italic>
               </xref>) without horns, the mask crowned the niches of sixth to eighth century Licchavicaityas, and was later found on capitals, lintels, and jambs of thirteenth to sixteenth century portals. In many cases, the mask either disgorges or receives strands of water that simply frame the niches or emerge from cloud foliage. Whether a <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> disgorges or receives water remains contested. The head also represents <italic>K&#257;la</italic>, a term that is associated with time, the sun, and death. Time is the source of the primordial waters and, as such, <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> disgorges water. Associated with the sun, the head also represents the cosmic fire, which periodically annihilates the world; thus, <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> both produces and dispels water. In order to stress the act of dissolving water, the strand of cloud foliage assumed the scaled body of a snake sometime in the sixteenth century. With the emergence of the snake&#8217;s body, <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> appeared to have two arms whose hands were grasping a pair of snakes. These arms emerge from a feathered background on both sides of the head or mask. These feathered arms suggest &#8220;aerial king&#8221; associations.</p>
        <p>In a rare variation, the depiction of <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> crowning the tympana of the small Yantaju shrine in the main courtyard (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcb5f7c2c-f929-4037-a1e6-78d893bdd0d5">M&#363;cuka</xref>) of the Patan palace has a pair of widespread wings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa347cfb4-4297-4e09-abf9-cc4de8748ca6">Fig. 13</xref>). Only on the tympanum facing north are there preserved fragments of a unique, three-dimensional demon head, which demonstrates the creativity of the early eighteenth century. For the first and probably the only time, <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> has outspread wings (<xref rid="TO_LINK" ref-type="bibr" id="ID390c34e9-5d01-4fee-ab4d-4f26d35d7107">measuring forty-eight centimetres</xref>) with two registers of seven feathers each, framing the mask. A pair of hands with only the indication of wrists emerges from below the wings, firmly grasping the scaly bodies. The snake bodies end in a knot, with only a short, two centimetre long tail visible upon close inspection. The knotted end, presented below a fiery arch, possibly demonstrates the snake&#8217;s resistance to being devoured and thus being exposed to the inevitable cycle of death and rebirth. The head of <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> projects eight centimetres from a background of lotus leaves, worked in shallow relief. The mask has a third eye and upright ears entangled in horns, with a flat lotus flower in between, as well as a jewel surrounded by five more jewels placed vertically behind a curly mane. The face itself is surrounded by smaller curls that seem to indicate the neck of the hybrid creature, while a moustache indicates its male identity. What cannot be seen on the elevation drawing is the mouth, complete with upper and lower jaw. From behind the chin, two jewels are suspended which emerge from the mouth in those cases where the face has only an upper jaw.</p>
        <p>[Fig. 13 here]</p>
        <p>By the end of the eighteenth century, the spirits began to lose their elegance and assume a stiff, repetitive form. As such, they competed with depictions of dragons in occupying the spandrels of nineteenth century doors and windows. The routine of presenting accepted motifs was at times overcome in an effort to create variations of flying hybrid spirits. Throughout the nineteenth century, the Buddhist monastic courtyards witnessed beautification programmes in the course of which new arches, gates, pairs of lions guarding the main shrine, flags, and gilt copper repouss&#233; attached to doorways, tympana, and windows were created. In the context of such an effort, a free-standing golden gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDa5495612-1ba4-404f-8969-d4105093de4a" rid="TO_LINK">Nev. <italic>suvar&#7751;adv&#257;ra</italic>
               </xref>) was donated, to honour the main shrine of Bub&#257;h&#257;, in Patan. A <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> occupies the apex of the cusped arch, and a pair of <italic>makaras</italic> the bottom ends, their heads turned away from the arch. To fill the gap between the <italic>makaras</italic> and the arch, a pair of winged spirits is presented in a rare frontal view (Fig. 14). </p>
        <p>[Fig. 14 here]</p>
        <p>The fluttering scarves around their necks, their large earrings, necklaces, and garlands are reminiscent of early Malla-period wisdom bearers. The ribbed halo appears for the first time, simplifying an age-old motif that had been reserved for the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. The widespread wings with four registers of feathers are given uncharacteristic prominence, while the body of the garland bearer seems to emerge from a cloud that moves towards the arch. Thus the original wisdom bearer turns into a winged cloud man. The wings and cloud have been borrowed from the winged, angel-like spirit walking on clouds. With the cloud becoming part of the spirit, the original water symbolism&#8212;the <italic>gandharva</italic> guarding the rain, or representing the rain cloud itself&#8212;becomes even more apparent.</p>

        <title>Celestial musicians, wisdom bearers, bird men, faces of glory, and angels in perspective</title>
        <p>Hybrid creatures such as leogryphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID0a2e1461-b7dd-46a7-8636-d78b808066b5" rid="TO_LINK">Skt. <italic>&#347;&#257;rd&#363;la</italic>
               </xref>) have always been depicted with forelegs equipped with wings originating at their knees. These hybrids then turned into ithyphallic, and thus apotropaic, winged leonine creatures equipped with horns and appeared on corner struts (Nev.<italic> k&#361;sal&#257;</italic>, lit. &#8220;corner horse&#8221;), or were exposed two-dimensionally on wall brackets of windows (Nev. <italic>bvasal&#257;</italic>, lit. &#8220;flying horse&#8221;). From the mid-seventeenth century, dragons (Nev. <italic>mala&#7717;</italic>) with wings on their forelegs replaced the earlier motifs on capitals, doors, and windows. Finally, in the nineteenth century, a plethora of leonine creatures with wings started guarding the stairs and entrances of Buddhist shrines and Hindu temples alike. The fact that even <italic>k&#299;rtimukha</italic> was equipped with wings shows the fascination of the craftsmen and their patrons with the notion of flight.</p>
        <p>It would be too digressive to search for traces of wings in Tuscan hippocampi (seahorses with the forelegs of a horse and the tail of a fish), Mesopotamian, Scythian snake dragons, or Roman <italic>genii,</italic> all of which contributed to the creation of hybrid beings that moved between the clouds in the sky and the ocean. Borrowed from birds, wings were to herald the capacity of these creatures to remain in between, in mid-air.</p>
        <p>The change from wingless spirits associated with clouds and their potential for showering rain, thus sustaining life, to winged spirits demonstrates but one example of decisive change in a transcultural process on the periphery of the Great Tradition of the Gangetic plains. For more than a thousand years, the bearing of the spirits indicated movement in mid-air. The legs bent backwards, below the raised upper body, convincingly demonstrated the airborne nature of the spirits.</p>
        <p>To comply with new representations of airborne abilities that were either witnessed by Newar nobles at the Mughal palaces of Lahore or Agra, or brought by merchants in pictorial form, the former spirits were transformed into angelic spirits, winged and clad in outlandish dress. Shaped after Christian and Islamic prototypes, this fundamental change in the iconography of the spirits did not, however, affect their former function. In order to be contemporary, the guardians of niches, doors, and window openings, which once marked the transition between inside and outside, were now flying with the help of wings. The bodies of flying spirits lost their dynamic motion and attained a new posture reminiscent of floating, with horizontally-stretched legs. Later, these floating figures were equipped with wings, to comply with the fashion of the day.</p>
        <p>The transition from wingless towards winged celestial spirits of the <italic>vidy&#257;dhara </italic>and <italic>gandharva</italic> variety in Newar seventeenth century iconography, presented here as a case study, could lead to a more general presentation of the beneficial and malicious creatures populating Nepal&#8217;s transcultural sky. </p>
